 OMG. Everyone loves Katniss and she has no idea why. I have no idea either.... 
 Okay, right off the bat I have to admit that the love triangle drove me absolutely crazy. Peeta or Gale? Who the fuck cares? BUT I can say that I thought there was care in how Suzanne Collins explained the Katniss love. I would have really rolled my eyes if Peeta had said "there's just something different about her." I thought it was much better to tell that his dad was in love with her mom and pointed Katniss out to Peeta when he was young. Also the dad showed Katniss special favor when she sold him her game. Okay, this makes it a more believable situation where she would catch Peeta's attention. The fact that her and Gale formed a bond naturally around hunting is passable too. But the whole best friend turned lover thing is tired and boring, but forgivable I guess. 
 NOW THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY... I do like the dystopian setting of this book. The way that the capitol keeps control of the country and the citizens through zero tolerance patriotism, and the yearly punishment of forcing children to fight to the death in an arena while the games are broadcast to the entire nation. Considering the premise I didn't think the book was quite as dark as I had expected. I am not sure what I expected, but I can see why this is still acceptable among YA readers. 
 I did take a little bit of issue with the arena ending. I read all three books before writing these reviews so I can see why they made the arena ending the way they did. BUT I also think that because they made such a big deal about people being drawn to the love story between Katniss and Peeta, that to take away their promise of two survivors and to force one of them to kill the other at the end of the games might have been enough to spark a rebellion anyway. 
 I had a love/hate relationship with Katniss as a character. I think in this book I mostly liked her. Though I thought she was immature at times I had to remind myself that she was only supposed to be 16 or 17 years old. I thought many elements of her character were overplayed stereotypes. The strong young girl who pays no attention to boys, and is temperamental and harsh but still manages to have two boys in love with her at the same time. Old and tired. Why can't she be those things MINUS the attention from boys. We don't need to teach our daughters that they are validated because someone loves them despite their being bitchy and off-putting. And she was kinda bitchy and off-putting. I suppose that isn't much different from a typical teenage girl in a lot of ways, but maybe if we rewarded our characters for kindness over aloofness we may influence our teens to be kinder and less aloof. Maybe not. But I digress... there were elements of her that were admirable. Her undying love and protection of her sister and her bond with Rue in the arena showed that she did have a softer, kinder side that she reserved for only a few. She had some character flaws and vulnerabilities which made her more realistic and likeable. I was drawn into her story and wanted to read on to the rest of the series to find out what happens with her."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man". But I recently came across Junot Diaz's reading list for his writing class and noticed "The Hunger Games" there. It sparked curiosity and an assumption that if the plot was cheesy, at least this story would be a good model for writing. Indeed, it is an excellent model. The story is well-paced, compelling, and full of content. At first I thought that the themes of trust and friendship would undergird all the action and page-turning suspense. Yet I was pleased to see the critical commentary on modern society that Collin's hit on, especially the disgusting effects of reality TV, namely the sick level of exploitation in entertainment and the lack of empathy from those who control and profit from the system. Also, I liked how, through Katniss, the author lays bare our sense of audience-- that the characters have no privacy and their lives are constantly broadcasted for public consumption. I think this is very relevant, especially for young readers, with the dominance of online social media. Nor does Collin's miss the opportunity to make subtle yet clear comments on classism and inequality between the Districts. The only criticism I have is that I did not really like the voice of the narrator. Katniss is not particularly endearing, but sharp and practical. The character even describes herself as coming across as "heartless." Perhaps-- as the traditional gender roles have been reversed-- this is part of her survival adaptation, and winning the games proves her tact correct. Overall, I was impressed with the layers of meaning in this YA novel and it's entertainment value, despite its already being a huge commercial success."  # Generated from value "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man".

Yet I was pleased to see the critical commentary on modern society that Collin's hit on, especially the disgusting effects of reality TV, namely the sick level of exploitation in entertainment and the lack of empathy from those who control and profit from the system. Also, I liked how, through Katniss, the author lays bare our sense of audience-- that the characters have no privacy and their lives are constantly broadcasted for public consumption. I think this is very relevant, especially for young readers, with the dominance of online social media. Nor does Collin's miss the opportunity to make subtle yet clear comments on classism and inequality between the Districts. The only criticism I have is that I did not really like the voice of the narrator. Katniss is not particularly endearing, but sharp and practical. The character even describes herself as coming across as "heartless." Perhaps-- as the traditional gender roles have been reversed-- this is part of her survival adaptation, and winning the games proves her tact correct. Overall, I was impressed with the layers of meaning in this YA novel and it's entertainment value, despite its already being a huge commercial success." located at cell 'reviews'!E4.,

 4.5 out of 5 stars 
 SPOILERS! But really I doubt you haven't read it yet! 
 So how can I review a book that's been read by everyone and made into movies love by everyone? LIKE THIS 
 This book takes place in a dystopian American society. The country now has a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer districts that only exist to produce goods for the capital. This novel centers around Katniss, a girl from the coal mining district 12. She's very poor and has to provide for her family in order for them to survive. Also In this society every year the Capitol has a competition called The Hunger Games. In these games, teenagers from all twelve districts are picked from a "reaping" and forced to fight to the death in these games. This is because before this society was created, the districts tried to rebel against the capitol and reach independence. When they failed, the Hunger games were created as punishment. This year, Katniss' younger sister is chosen. Rather than watch her sister be killed, she volunteers to go to the games in her place. 
 Now here's what I liked. Katniss. I LOVE Katniss. She's strong, she's practical, and she breaks down every single trope of YA heroines that you can think of. The book is in her POV. Part of the fun of the book is getting inside her head to see how she strategizes and how she reacts to the cruelty of the games. I also liked how district life felt almost historical, like it took place in the past. Then we get to the Capitol and it feels like science fiction. Then when we get to the actual games it feels like a survival story. The fact that all the sub-genres are seamlessly woven together is what makes this book so fun to read. It was fast paced and had wonderful side characters as well. 
 Now here are some things I, not disliked, but kind of expected more of because of all the hype. First, Rue's death was a little anti-climactic. I expected it to have more of an impact on Katniss than it did. Another thing was Peeta. I spent most of the book thinking that , like Katniss, he was faking the whole being in love thing. But him really being in love with her felt a little unnecessary. At least in this book. I felt it might've fit in later books. And there was one thing I really didn't understand. WTF WERE THE WOLF PEOPLE? Were they just designed to look like the dead tributes? Or were they the dead tributes made into wolf people? I don't understand. 
 So there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been already said. I really enjoyed the book, I had to read it for an English class. Still haven't seen the movie, will watch it today probably. And I hope everyone else has read it and enjoyed it as much as I did."  # Generated from value "The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins

 I finished reading Twilight today. Took me about a day to read as it is such a quick read. I'm sure you've all read this. I put it off as long as possible. 
 I have a friend who had never read the Harry Potter series. She promised me she would read it if I read the Twilight series, so here I am. 
 I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Did I enjoy this? For a young reader, yes. I think it's more suited for high schoolers and younger. For adults? Meh. Here's my thoughts 
 It's a love story with a vampire. The beginning I thought was cute as it brought back the fun innocence of a crush (I've been married for a while now so this was fun to relive). Ex. The excitement of simply being in the same room or standing next to a person. I found that enduring. But once they had kissed, I saw red flags. Edward never let her make decisions. He always was telling her what was best for her, despite her protests... but she doesn't fight him too hard. You'd think after a while she'd get fed up. I would. Edward also couldn't keep his story straight. Ex. "I promise I'll be with you for forever. You'll never be alone. I love you." Then a few paragraphs later we get "It's not safe for you to be with me. We shouldn't be together." This happens continually throughout the book. His wishy-washy back and forth attitude was so reminiscent of high school dating. (Hence why I felt this was suited for a younger audience - you know this is the drama they crave). {I'm not denying I was like this. It's just obnoxious now} 
 Now Jacob. He wasn't in it too much. However, he actually asked and listened to what's Bella wanted. And he complimented her (Edward didn't always return compliments). And he made her relax. I also hated how he grew exponentially while she was away (she came back and he's 6'2"). I don't know of anyone who has a growth spurt that extreme. 
 I don't know which team I'm on yet as this first book doesn't really present you with an either-or conundrum. It was all about Bella and Edward. So I remain neutral. 
 Lastly, they left a loose end that bothered me. Bella calls her mom and leaves a voicemail frantically asking her to call before returning home. It turns out the bad guy intercepted it and responded. However, after he dies, mom shows up at the hospital to see Bella and never once mentions the voicemail. There's no way she wouldn't have called her moms cell phone. I know cell phones existed in this story because Bella used one to call her mom. And if she knew her mom wasn't home, why leave a message on a home message machine (plus - who even had those anymore?). So... mom should've clued in to the crazy that was going down in Phoenix. That bugged me. 
 Alright your Twilight fans. Do your worst. Tear me apart."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere. Girl meets boy. Boy barely manages to avoid eating girl. Boy and girl fall in love with each other. Boy stalks girl. Girl's okay with that. Boy probably won't kill girl, but he's making no promises. It's got a lot I like in a book passionate, chaste love-triangle-free romance (for the most part, if you stick to the first book); fantasy with a new perspective; excitement; a lot of pages. It's also repetitive, problematic, badly written. I was pretty surprised to see that I for the first time I couldn't enjoy it as much as before. Largely because for the first time, I read Edward as having no redeeming qualities. 
 Edward Cullen is cold. I'm not talking about his stone lips. I never realized before how mean and uncaring he is. Anytime Bella is uncomfortable or unhappy, he's laughing at her. Intellectually, I knew that the Edward/Bella relationship is abusive and controlling. But I didn't realize how much Edward uses that awful put-the-girl-down-to-make-her-like-you technique. Ugh. Edward Cullen is definitely not what Twilight has going for it. 
 Here's where Twilight's strengths are: The romantic/sexual tension in this book is largely very good. While I didn't find the meadow scene particularly compelling this go around, the build up to the first kiss is excellent. 
 The book really feels like two different books. The first chapter through the baseball scene, plus the epilogue feel like one book, while the prologue and baseball scene to the last chapter has a totally different tone. While somewhat suspenseful, the first portion is a meandering romance, while the latter portion feels like a somewhat dull thriller. 
 Overall, I wouldn't stop recommending this to fans of romance who can handle cheese. Although a handout identifying warning signs of abusive relationships nearby on the shelf wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm sure it's not my last reread, either. 
 Why people turn on Twilight: 
 -embarrassment because/ feeling of betrayal that they had liked Edward 
 -Breaking Dawn There are so many things embarrassingly much worse about that book compared to the rest of the series. It breaks all the rules of the world that have been set up previously. Everything about Renesmee from her name to existence is ridiculous. And things with Jacob get very squicky. 
 -because it inspires feverous praise, and then later people are embarrassed they praised it so much when they realize how flawed its writing/romance is 
 -because it's just plain kind of embarrassingly cheesy"  # Generated from value "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere.

         hasContent "A must read, this book is from the eyes of a child. This book provides a window into all levels of hypocrisy entrenched in human behaviour. Atticus finch is perhaps one of the best father figures to shape men of fiction and reality after. He embodies what it is like to live in a dual and still somehow be right and grow noble children. Apart from the central tale of what humans are collectively possible of, there are many other pluses to the Novel. 
 The narrative is very convincing and the portrayal as well as character development is quite well done. The use of humor is also quite good. A thoroughly enjoyable book."  # Generated from value "A must read, this book is from the eyes of a child. This book provides a window into all levels of hypocrisy entrenched in human behaviour.

         hasContent "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still. As hard as it may be to fathom this, I didn't know anything about the novel other than its Great Depression, Deep South setting. It is certainly eye opening today to hear the liberal use of racial epithets (the N word most notably) although it is certainly in keeping with the times and the location. 
 As much as I am fighting against it, I am a literary philistine when it comes to classic fiction. I spend most of my leisure reading time on non-fiction of all types so my reviews and ratings are often filtered through that lens. I very much enjoyed this novel, speaking as it does to the vile force that was and is racism in this country. Atticus Finch is certainly a worthy hero and I can see why this book is often taught in schools, despite the racism that is front and center. Atticus' attitude and belief system is admirable and his integrity shines through the whole narrative. His is certainly an attitude to life worth emulating. 
 The plot is not complex, taking place over three years but the racial themes, the loss of innocence, the lack of real justice and the humanity that runs through the narrator's father certainly make it pretty gripping reading. I am glad I read it and feel better informed, in my own small way, on a subject that is viscerally important to my liberal, bleeding heart!"  # Generated from value "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still.

 Angels & Demons... 
 This Dan Brown should be proud of himself...really. 
 This book and Da Vinci Code got me thinking...who the hell Dan Brown is. What is his academic background? I guess if the Illuminati ever came back to life and intended the wipe out Catholicism, they would drain their brains as they might but they wouldn't be able to come up with a plot as perfect and devilish as that of Dan Brown. This guy knows more than professors of history, physicists and religion men do; or at least he is a damn good researcher with an exceptional knowledge of rare fields like symbology and cryptography and a deep understanding of art, history and religions. It takes a smart professor of symbology to solve the riddles in the novel, but it takes a genius writer to create these riddles in the first place. Dan Brown is a genius. He really is. The air of mystery and apprehension in the novel is masterfully crafted that it engrossed me even when I off the book. I have to admit, I suspected all the characters. I suspected ALL of them except Langdon and Vittoria. I had to keep a computer close by so that every now and then I'd check google and youtube on scientific terms and historical facts. For me, this novel was not just a book; it was a whole experience. 
 Five stars...Yes. I fully enjoyed it... it is fairly long but you wouldn't wish it to end. My impression is mainly positive except for two points. The work as a whole deserves 5 stars nonetheless. 
 What I have to comment on rather than criticism is (spoilers coming ahead) 1) the Hassassin; the stereotypical sex-crazy terrorist barbaric Muslim Arab! Being a Muslim Arab, I felt offended. Plus... Come one Dan Brown, I guess you know better. The Hassassins, though considered a Shittii sect, were not at all religious. So I doubt that their descendants would in any way hold grudges against the church for sending the Crusaders centuries ago. And the few Arabic words the guy used - just to sound Arab - are of the Egyptian Dialect, while the Hassassins descendants, if any, would never be Egyptians. This might sound trivial (and this is why I didn't let this point affect my review) but the second point... I guess the director of the film version of the book would agree with me ... has to do with logic of events. Spinning over 128 chapters, the story was about a plot masterminded and carried out by a secret society; the Illuminati are many; they infiltrate organizations and hence, they are capable of carrying out an attack with the scale of that described in the novel; they can infiltrate the CERN, the Vatican; church, archives; monuments and all, the can infiltrate the Swiss Guard and the Vatican Police. This I understand. But reaching the end (folded in ONLY 9 chapters out of 137), it turned out that the whole plot was the work of a single guy! He is powerful; but he is one still. He imagined the full scenario and he had motives (a little bit overrated - but I think the author is implying that he was psychologically troubled). But when I tried to reconstruct the story from the new view point (that the camerlengo was the one behind the whole thing because he believed that the popessssss are not truly faithful to God), I had many questions that I couldn't find answers to; How did he recruit the Hassassin? Really? He did the whole thing in less then a month. How did he get that illuminati Muslim Arab Hassassin and convinced him to carry this out in revenge for his ancestors? In the film, the assassin did it for money, which was logical. But in the novel? It was all out of faith and loyalty. 2) How did he infiltrate the the CERN? Money? Maybe ..it just needed to be made clear. Guess to my humble mind, this is a very difficult fortress to break into. And finally, when the Hassassin called in the camerlengo's office, did he not recognize the guy's voice, since their relationship was only telephonic? Should I comment on Langdon's surviving a 3 mile fall from the helicopter? No, I won't. I still enjoyed the book greatly and still recommend it to everyone."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

A man and a woman who have no chance of being together, and for most of the story do not even like each other, find themselves drawn in more and more by each other and in the end live happily ever after.

I thought it also cleverly makes fun of the ridiculous social constructs of the time and the manner in which people are expected to address one another.

I see why it is an important work and a classic and I enjoyed a fair bit of it but, at the same time, the style got in the way of me loving it unreservedly. Which is funny in some ways since I have read other books from this time period and not had such a reaction. I suppose it lies in Austen's peculiar own brand. This also, by the way, signals the first time a BOOK kicked my embarrassment squick into gear. Between Mrs. Bennet and Lydia, I just about crawled out of my skin a few times. On the other hand, there are some awesome lines and it felt like such a joyous relief when Darcy and Lizzie got on the same page and started being playful because, gawd, it's about time."  # Generated from value "I'm honestly torn here.

The struggle to form an identity, and how the faction she rejections continued to define her...and how living in the space between factions was seen as dangerous resonated with my religious journey. The only real downside for me was the villians. I felt that the motivations of enemy faction were rather plastic and cartoonish.

         hasContent "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read. My thoughts after reading this? I am still not sure... 
 Overall this book was an entertaining exciting read where if you ignore the fictional world and its gaps, it was pretty good for about 3/4 of it. At first I was concerned since the first 80 pages or so reminded me of a retelling of The Giver. I found too many similarities in the plot that bothered me but eventually I overlooked that and enjoyed the quick fun read. 
 I have to admit I found Tris really dumb at times and would roll my eyes at parts so I am not too attached to her as a main character. 
 Reading along, I was hoping that this would be one of the first dystopian novels I would love - but then like all the other novels similar to this - the plot gets weird and force-fed to the reader. We happily follow a solid plot then it twists to something messed up AND just as we learn characters, the author kills them off. 
 I am still confused on how I feel about this book as I really enjoyed majority of it BUT I hope this isnt a series that gets even more messed up that completely derails."  # Generated from value "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read.

You've got the girl that ends up being a bad ass "chosen-one," you got a teenage forbidden romance, you've got the classic bad guy, a little loyalty, a little betrayal, and a lot of action. The premise seemed a little manufactured. Perhaps it would be appropriate to call the author of this book "Dr. Frankenstein" as she seems to create a story from plots found in the dystopian futuristic graveyard. Oddly enough, despite the cookie cutter premise, I really enjoyed reading this book. It it's the ground running and drags you along whether you want to or not.

         hasContent "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency. 
 The book is turned out to be so effective. Whether it's the sympathy driven success since a young girl who seems to be very refine writer got snatched the right to flourish naturally. Or it is real good write up. 
 I liked it because my rational mind accepts it rather than the emotional part would be swayed away by the ordeal of the girl. 
 At the age of 13 she is reading mythology and studying different languages. Reading was such a heavy part of her life, and not some ordinary reading (language, philosophy etc). The way she endured pain during hiding, thought critically and drew opinions based on her knowledge, reviewing books in a context that was related to her ordeal/life is something I held on to very dearly while reading. She had a clear idea what she wanted to do once they finish the hiding (spending time in Germany and London to get education on history of arts, languages). Some of the ideas like, 'the old people supposed to be less confused since they dealt with the hard part already and have pretty much worked out their ways than the younger evolving youth' and 'when you are upset, instead of holding on to the people who are miserable since their misery can make you realize the blessings in your life, one should rely on the happiness and colours around' are quite fascinating. She use to go back to the old entries in diary and see her complaining self which she found as "ungrateful". 
 The end makes me wonder how terrified she must had felt when they were caught and above all how desperate she had been to leave her dear kitty behind. How she had lived the next 6-7 months without writing. Her intellectual self-had the need to shed itself. How she had kept insanity without talking to Kitty, since that was one major thing which kept her going. 
 Anyhow, in the end, Kitty did do justice by bringing Anne Frank to the world. Otherwise we would have never known the intelligent girl like many others who must had been lost in evil-selfish human warmongering conquests."  # Generated from value "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency.

 UGH. This one was the worst... 
 I honestly don't know why this book is so highly rated. This one was definitely the worst of the three. It was a complete repeat of book one. I liked the beginning where she was starting to get little hints and glimpses that there was a rebellion starting in some of the districts. That part was exciting and I wanted to watch more of that unfold, but before I knew it we were back in the God damned arena. And then it was exactly like the first book, people dying all over the place, alliances being formed, and knowing all along that she's going to figure some way out of there for her and Peeta. She kept rambling on about sacrificing herself for Peeta and her martyrdom was SO.FUCKING.ANNOYING. We all knew she and Peeta weren't going to die. There was so much "action" in this one that I didn't even get a chance to care about anyone else in the arena with her. So as people were dying, even ones in her alliance, I did not find myself caring all that much. Maybe I had resigned myself to the belief that they might all die (except Katniss and Peeta) so I didn't allow myself to get attached to any of them. 
 So my advice would be to skip a whole bunch of chapters until they figure out how to blow up the arena and then pick it back up there. Then it gets more interesting again. But I felt left out of the uprising, left out of the "Catching Fire" that was the title of the book. We see little glimpses and then by the time they get rescued it's all out war. We don't get to see how the action in the arena has influenced the people of the districts and the rebellion. So I thought it was a lot of lazy writing. A lot of missed opportunities by going back into the arena. It could have been so much better if Katniss and Peeta had been mentors to the games, and we could have been involved in the rebellion alliance and then we could have been a part of the arena AND been better positioned to get information of the districts' uprising. She could have formed many of the same bonds with the other past tributes by way of her tribute forming alliances with theirs. But I guess it's no good to dwell on all the ways you could have written a better sequel. Anywho I don't have a lot else to say about this one."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "These books are way more subversive and dark than Harry Potter! Was I born in the wrong era in terms of wildly popular nerdy book trends? Perhaps so, because Katniss is so cool, with her proto-Artemis/Diana quiver and arrows, and her disdain for leg-shaving and desire to just live alone. I love too that defiance in the world of the hunger games is kindness and solidarity rather than blind self-interest and individualism. The whole series is a demented reversal of Gil Scot Heron's "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" in which the whole revolution is played out in hyperreality and simulacra, and not only the revolution, but the counter revolution will in fact be televised.

         hasContent "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it. This story that Collins has created, one about oppression and government control, rebellion and fighting for freedom, is so well done. There is never a dull moment. Everything that happens is happening for a reason, and the pacing is just perfect. 
 I know many people are upset that Katniss lost her "badassery-ness" from the first book, but really, this just made me connect with and understand her even more. What she went through in the first Games, and all the terrible stuff afterwards, is horrifying. Of course it's going to affect her. So many characters nowadays don't seem to feel anything - they just push away all the bad thoughts and keep fighting. They're kinda like Gale, in a way. Running on rage and not really taking in and dealing with all the bad. 
 Katniss isn't like that. What she went through, what she experienced, it affected her. It changed her. And that makes her character even more realistic. Friends were killed, she had to kill, she had to see the repercussions of her actions - these types of things affect you in ways you cannot imagine. She will never be just another girl from District 12. How could she be, after all she went through? 
 Collins has created a dynamic, complex cast of characters, and she is not afraid to kill them off. They are at war, after all. Death is to be expected. The only thing I'm not sure about is the last couple of chapters (not the epilogue). I like how everything resolved, just not sure in the way it resolved. But the more I think about it, the more I like it. Not a thing should be changed. 
 Also, I completely understand why Katniss did what she did, throughout the whole series. Any decisions she made, any actions she took, I understood her reasoning why, and almost always agreed with her. It's not easy to create a character in which readers truly understand, but Collins has done it here. She created a personality for Katniss that, while it did change based on what happened around her, the base of her character was always there. Splendid job in that regard. 
 Now, the epilogue. Maybe some people hate it, but honestly, I love it. It's so extremely powerful, and that last line? Yeah, that's a last sentence that I will always remember, word for word. It is the perfect way to end this series. Bravo, Suzanne Collins. Bravo.

 Well that escalated quickly! This one was my favorite of the series.... 
 Talk about a 180! The last book was boring and unimpressive, people were dying everywhere but I didn't give a fuck. This one, just the opposite. Almost all of my favorite characters die. It was sad, it was painful, it had emotion. Raw, real, guttural emotion. 
 I thought Suzanne Collins painted a pretty good picture of war. Particularly that there are no winners in war. We are introduced to district thirteen and immediately made uncomfortable by their militarized governing. There are so many rules here that it's almost worse than living in the districts. Though no one is left to die in the streets the way they were in district 12, there are very few real freedoms here. There's definitely subtle (or maybe not so subtle) stabs at both extreme conservative capitalism (in Panem there's no regulation and no gov't assistance, it's every man for himself) and extreme communism (in district 13 everyone eats exactly the number of calories they need, and everyone wears the same clothes and is provided identical living quarters). Suzanne Collins artfully shows how both extremes lead back to the same tyranny and oppression. We wanted so desperately to believe that district 13 was some kind of utopia of freedom, but in their attempt to be the exact opposite of the capitol and everything it stood for, they turned themselves into the capitol. 
 We are also introduced to another leader of the people, Coin. Katniss isn't sure what to make of her and neither are we. I wish she had delved a little more completely into the corruption of power, because by the time we meet Coin we are already a little leery of her and her motivations. As the book goes on we get to see more and more that Coin is not a friend to Katniss and by the end we don't believe that Coin is going to be any better than Snow as a leader of Panem. I cheered when Katniss took her down. 
 Katniss was suffering from a clear case of PTSD throughout this book, and considering all she went through up until this book (and then a shit-ton more during this book!) she deserved to be a little out of sorts. It made her even more real than the first two books could have. She was vulnerable and unsure and not the picture of the rebellion that district thirteen wanted her to be. In some ways I was disappointed that she didn't take over the capitol herself, but in others I am really glad that she didn't. I hated that her sister died, but it was the perfect catalyst to bring Katniss to question what she was a part of. If her sister hadn't died, she wouldn't have been lead down the path of discovering just who Coin was and what she was capable of doing. I like that Katniss was a complete mess after it all went down. Like I said before, there are no winners in war."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

 OMG. Everyone loves Katniss and she has no idea why. I have no idea either.... 
 Okay, right off the bat I have to admit that the love triangle drove me absolutely crazy. Peeta or Gale? Who the fuck cares? BUT I can say that I thought there was care in how Suzanne Collins explained the Katniss love. I would have really rolled my eyes if Peeta had said "there's just something different about her." I thought it was much better to tell that his dad was in love with her mom and pointed Katniss out to Peeta when he was young. Also the dad showed Katniss special favor when she sold him her game. Okay, this makes it a more believable situation where she would catch Peeta's attention. The fact that her and Gale formed a bond naturally around hunting is passable too. But the whole best friend turned lover thing is tired and boring, but forgivable I guess. 
 NOW THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY... I do like the dystopian setting of this book. The way that the capitol keeps control of the country and the citizens through zero tolerance patriotism, and the yearly punishment of forcing children to fight to the death in an arena while the games are broadcast to the entire nation. Considering the premise I didn't think the book was quite as dark as I had expected. I am not sure what I expected, but I can see why this is still acceptable among YA readers. 
 I did take a little bit of issue with the arena ending. I read all three books before writing these reviews so I can see why they made the arena ending the way they did. BUT I also think that because they made such a big deal about people being drawn to the love story between Katniss and Peeta, that to take away their promise of two survivors and to force one of them to kill the other at the end of the games might have been enough to spark a rebellion anyway. 
 I had a love/hate relationship with Katniss as a character. I think in this book I mostly liked her. Though I thought she was immature at times I had to remind myself that she was only supposed to be 16 or 17 years old. I thought many elements of her character were overplayed stereotypes. The strong young girl who pays no attention to boys, and is temperamental and harsh but still manages to have two boys in love with her at the same time. Old and tired. Why can't she be those things MINUS the attention from boys. We don't need to teach our daughters that they are validated because someone loves them despite their being bitchy and off-putting. And she was kinda bitchy and off-putting. I suppose that isn't much different from a typical teenage girl in a lot of ways, but maybe if we rewarded our characters for kindness over aloofness we may influence our teens to be kinder and less aloof. Maybe not. But I digress... there were elements of her that were admirable. Her undying love and protection of her sister and her bond with Rue in the arena showed that she did have a softer, kinder side that she reserved for only a few. She had some character flaws and vulnerabilities which made her more realistic and likeable. I was drawn into her story and wanted to read on to the rest of the series to find out what happens with her."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man". But I recently came across Junot Diaz's reading list for his writing class and noticed "The Hunger Games" there. It sparked curiosity and an assumption that if the plot was cheesy, at least this story would be a good model for writing. Indeed, it is an excellent model. The story is well-paced, compelling, and full of content. At first I thought that the themes of trust and friendship would undergird all the action and page-turning suspense. Yet I was pleased to see the critical commentary on modern society that Collin's hit on, especially the disgusting effects of reality TV, namely the sick level of exploitation in entertainment and the lack of empathy from those who control and profit from the system. Also, I liked how, through Katniss, the author lays bare our sense of audience-- that the characters have no privacy and their lives are constantly broadcasted for public consumption. I think this is very relevant, especially for young readers, with the dominance of online social media. Nor does Collin's miss the opportunity to make subtle yet clear comments on classism and inequality between the Districts. The only criticism I have is that I did not really like the voice of the narrator. Katniss is not particularly endearing, but sharp and practical. The character even describes herself as coming across as "heartless." Perhaps-- as the traditional gender roles have been reversed-- this is part of her survival adaptation, and winning the games proves her tact correct. Overall, I was impressed with the layers of meaning in this YA novel and it's entertainment value, despite its already being a huge commercial success."  # Generated from value "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man".

 4.5 out of 5 stars 
 SPOILERS! But really I doubt you haven't read it yet! 
 So how can I review a book that's been read by everyone and made into movies love by everyone? LIKE THIS 
 This book takes place in a dystopian American society. The country now has a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer districts that only exist to produce goods for the capital. This novel centers around Katniss, a girl from the coal mining district 12. She's very poor and has to provide for her family in order for them to survive. Also In this society every year the Capitol has a competition called The Hunger Games. In these games, teenagers from all twelve districts are picked from a "reaping" and forced to fight to the death in these games. This is because before this society was created, the districts tried to rebel against the capitol and reach independence. When they failed, the Hunger games were created as punishment. This year, Katniss' younger sister is chosen. Rather than watch her sister be killed, she volunteers to go to the games in her place. 
 Now here's what I liked. Katniss. I LOVE Katniss. She's strong, she's practical, and she breaks down every single trope of YA heroines that you can think of. The book is in her POV. Part of the fun of the book is getting inside her head to see how she strategizes and how she reacts to the cruelty of the games. I also liked how district life felt almost historical, like it took place in the past. Then we get to the Capitol and it feels like science fiction. Then when we get to the actual games it feels like a survival story. The fact that all the sub-genres are seamlessly woven together is what makes this book so fun to read. It was fast paced and had wonderful side characters as well. 
 Now here are some things I, not disliked, but kind of expected more of because of all the hype. First, Rue's death was a little anti-climactic. I expected it to have more of an impact on Katniss than it did. Another thing was Peeta. I spent most of the book thinking that , like Katniss, he was faking the whole being in love thing. But him really being in love with her felt a little unnecessary. At least in this book. I felt it might've fit in later books. And there was one thing I really didn't understand. WTF WERE THE WOLF PEOPLE? Were they just designed to look like the dead tributes? Or were they the dead tributes made into wolf people? I don't understand. 
 So there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been already said. I really enjoyed the book, I had to read it for an English class. Still haven't seen the movie, will watch it today probably. And I hope everyone else has read it and enjoyed it as much as I did."  # Generated from value "The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins

 I finished reading Twilight today. Took me about a day to read as it is such a quick read. I'm sure you've all read this. I put it off as long as possible. 
 I have a friend who had never read the Harry Potter series. She promised me she would read it if I read the Twilight series, so here I am. 
 I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Did I enjoy this? For a young reader, yes. I think it's more suited for high schoolers and younger. For adults? Meh. Here's my thoughts 
 It's a love story with a vampire. The beginning I thought was cute as it brought back the fun innocence of a crush (I've been married for a while now so this was fun to relive). Ex. The excitement of simply being in the same room or standing next to a person. I found that enduring. But once they had kissed, I saw red flags. Edward never let her make decisions. He always was telling her what was best for her, despite her protests... but she doesn't fight him too hard. You'd think after a while she'd get fed up. I would. Edward also couldn't keep his story straight. Ex. "I promise I'll be with you for forever. You'll never be alone. I love you." Then a few paragraphs later we get "It's not safe for you to be with me. We shouldn't be together." This happens continually throughout the book. His wishy-washy back and forth attitude was so reminiscent of high school dating.

 Now Jacob. He wasn't in it too much. However, he actually asked and listened to what's Bella wanted. And he complimented her (Edward didn't always return compliments). And he made her relax. I also hated how he grew exponentially while she was away (she came back and he's 6'2"). I don't know of anyone who has a growth spurt that extreme. 
 I don't know which team I'm on yet as this first book doesn't really present you with an either-or conundrum. It was all about Bella and Edward. So I remain neutral. 
 Lastly, they left a loose end that bothered me. Bella calls her mom and leaves a voicemail frantically asking her to call before returning home. It turns out the bad guy intercepted it and responded. However, after he dies, mom shows up at the hospital to see Bella and never once mentions the voicemail. There's no way she wouldn't have called her moms cell phone. I know cell phones existed in this story because Bella used one to call her mom. And if she knew her mom wasn't home, why leave a message on a home message machine (plus - who even had those anymore?). So... mom should've clued in to the crazy that was going down in Phoenix. That bugged me. 
 Alright your Twilight fans. Do your worst. Tear me apart."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert ** 
 I finished reading Twilight today. Took me about a day to read as it is such a quick read. I'm sure you've all read this. I put it off as long as possible. 
 I have a friend who had never read the Harry Potter series. She promised me she would read it if I read the Twilight series, so here I am. 
 I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Did I enjoy this? For a young reader, yes. I think it's more suited for high schoolers and younger. For adults? Meh. Here's my thoughts 
 It's a love story with a vampire. The beginning I thought was cute as it brought back the fun innocence of a crush (I've been married for a while now so this was fun to relive). Ex. The excitement of simply being in the same room or standing next to a person. I found that enduring. But once they had kissed, I saw red flags. Edward never let her make decisions. He always was telling her what was best for her, despite her protests... but she doesn't fight him too hard. You'd think after a while she'd get fed up. I would. Edward also couldn't keep his story straight. Ex. "I promise I'll be with you for forever. You'll never be alone. I love you." Then a few paragraphs later we get "It's not safe for you to be with me. We shouldn't be together." This happens continually throughout the book. His wishy-washy back and forth attitude was so reminiscent of high school dating. (Hence why I felt this was suited for a younger audience - you know this is the drama they crave). {I'm not denying I was like this. It's just obnoxious now} 
 Now Jacob. He wasn't in it too much. However, he actually asked and listened to what's Bella wanted. And he complimented her (Edward didn't always return compliments). And he made her relax.

         hasContent "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere. Girl meets boy. Boy barely manages to avoid eating girl. Boy and girl fall in love with each other. Boy stalks girl. Girl's okay with that. Boy probably won't kill girl, but he's making no promises. It's got a lot I like in a book passionate, chaste love-triangle-free romance (for the most part, if you stick to the first book); fantasy with a new perspective; excitement; a lot of pages. It's also repetitive, problematic, badly written. I was pretty surprised to see that I for the first time I couldn't enjoy it as much as before. Largely because for the first time, I read Edward as having no redeeming qualities. 
 Edward Cullen is cold. I'm not talking about his stone lips. I never realized before how mean and uncaring he is. Anytime Bella is uncomfortable or unhappy, he's laughing at her. Intellectually, I knew that the Edward/Bella relationship is abusive and controlling. But I didn't realize how much Edward uses that awful put-the-girl-down-to-make-her-like-you technique. Ugh. Edward Cullen is definitely not what Twilight has going for it. 
 Here's where Twilight's strengths are: The romantic/sexual tension in this book is largely very good. While I didn't find the meadow scene particularly compelling this go around, the build up to the first kiss is excellent. 
 The book really feels like two different books. The first chapter through the baseball scene, plus the epilogue feel like one book, while the prologue and baseball scene to the last chapter has a totally different tone. While somewhat suspenseful, the first portion is a meandering romance, while the latter portion feels like a somewhat dull thriller. 
 Overall, I wouldn't stop recommending this to fans of romance who can handle cheese. Although a handout identifying warning signs of abusive relationships nearby on the shelf wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm sure it's not my last reread, either. 
 Why people turn on Twilight: 
 -embarrassment because/ feeling of betrayal that they had liked Edward 
 -Breaking Dawn There are so many things embarrassingly much worse about that book compared to the rest of the series. It breaks all the rules of the world that have been set up previously. Everything about Renesmee from her name to existence is ridiculous. And things with Jacob get very squicky. 
 -because it inspires feverous praise, and then later people are embarrassed they praised it so much when they realize how flawed its writing/romance is 
 -because it's just plain kind of embarrassingly cheesy"  # Generated from value "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere.

As hard as it may be to fathom this, I didn't know anything about the novel other than its Great Depression, Deep South setting. It is certainly eye opening today to hear the liberal use of racial epithets (the N word most notably) although it is certainly in keeping with the times and the location. 
 As much as I am fighting against it, I am a literary philistine when it comes to classic fiction. I spend most of my leisure reading time on non-fiction of all types so my reviews and ratings are often filtered through that lens. I very much enjoyed this novel, speaking as it does to the vile force that was and is racism in this country. Atticus Finch is certainly a worthy hero and I can see why this book is often taught in schools, despite the racism that is front and center. Atticus' attitude and belief system is admirable and his integrity shines through the whole narrative. His is certainly an attitude to life worth emulating. 
 The plot is not complex, taking place over three years but the racial themes, the loss of innocence, the lack of real justice and the humanity that runs through the narrator's father certainly make it pretty gripping reading. I am glad I read it and feel better informed, in my own small way, on a subject that is viscerally important to my liberal, bleeding heart!"  # Generated from value "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still.

 Angels & Demons... 
 This Dan Brown should be proud of himself...really. 
 This book and Da Vinci Code got me thinking...who the hell Dan Brown is. What is his academic background? I guess if the Illuminati ever came back to life and intended the wipe out Catholicism, they would drain their brains as they might but they wouldn't be able to come up with a plot as perfect and devilish as that of Dan Brown. This guy knows more than professors of history, physicists and religion men do; or at least he is a damn good researcher with an exceptional knowledge of rare fields like symbology and cryptography and a deep understanding of art, history and religions. It takes a smart professor of symbology to solve the riddles in the novel, but it takes a genius writer to create these riddles in the first place. Dan Brown is a genius. He really is. The air of mystery and apprehension in the novel is masterfully crafted that it engrossed me even when I off the book. I have to admit, I suspected all the characters. I suspected ALL of them except Langdon and Vittoria. I had to keep a computer close by so that every now and then I'd check google and youtube on scientific terms and historical facts. For me, this novel was not just a book; it was a whole experience. 
 Five stars...Yes. I fully enjoyed it... it is fairly long but you wouldn't wish it to end. My impression is mainly positive except for two points. The work as a whole deserves 5 stars nonetheless. 
 What I have to comment on rather than criticism is (spoilers coming ahead) 1) the Hassassin; the stereotypical sex-crazy terrorist barbaric Muslim Arab! Being a Muslim Arab, I felt offended. Plus... Come one Dan Brown, I guess you know better. The Hassassins, though considered a Shittii sect, were not at all religious. So I doubt that their descendants would in any way hold grudges against the church for sending the Crusaders centuries ago. And the few Arabic words the guy used - just to sound Arab - are of the Egyptian Dialect, while the Hassassins descendants, if any, would never be Egyptians. This might sound trivial (and this is why I didn't let this point affect my review) but the second point... I guess the director of the film version of the book would agree with me ... has to do with logic of events. Spinning over 128 chapters, the story was about a plot masterminded and carried out by a secret society; the Illuminati are many; they infiltrate organizations and hence, they are capable of carrying out an attack with the scale of that described in the novel; they can infiltrate the CERN, the Vatican; church, archives; monuments and all, the can infiltrate the Swiss Guard and the Vatican Police. This I understand. But reaching the end (folded in ONLY 9 chapters out of 137), it turned out that the whole plot was the work of a single guy! He is powerful; but he is one still. He imagined the full scenario and he had motives (a little bit overrated - but I think the author is implying that he was psychologically troubled). But when I tried to reconstruct the story from the new view point (that the camerlengo was the one behind the whole thing because he believed that the popessssss are not truly faithful to God), I had many questions that I couldn't find answers to; How did he recruit the Hassassin? Really? He did the whole thing in less then a month. How did he get that illuminati Muslim Arab Hassassin and convinced him to carry this out in revenge for his ancestors? In the film, the assassin did it for money, which was logical. But in the novel? It was all out of faith and loyalty. 2) How did he infiltrate the the CERN? Money? Maybe ..it just needed to be made clear. Guess to my humble mind, this is a very difficult fortress to break into. And finally, when the Hassassin called in the camerlengo's office, did he not recognize the guy's voice, since their relationship was only telephonic? Should I comment on Langdon's surviving a 3 mile fall from the helicopter? No, I won't. I still enjoyed the book greatly and still recommend it to everyone."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

 I am currently making my way through "The Complete Novels of Jane Austen" (all 1278 pages of it) and Pride and Prejudice is book 2 of 7. Sense and Sensibility was first and although I appreciated Austen's humour and writing, I was not a fan of this novel. 
 So imagine my sheer delight when I loved P&P from page 1. There is laugh-out-loud humour, scandal, insufferable characters, loveable characters, and of course romance. I loved the way Austen developed the characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet who I see to be intelligent and smart, full of integrity, and quite the feminist.

A man and a woman who have no chance of being together, and for most of the story do not even like each other, find themselves drawn in more and more by each other and in the end live happily ever after. It is an overused premise nowadays, but I do have to give credit to Jane Austen seeing as she wrote it in 1813 and its basic plot structure has been copied a million different times, just proves her genius. I thought it also cleverly makes fun of the ridiculous social constructs of the time and the manner in which people are expected to address one another. This last point can get lost in the old English writing"  # Generated from value "Pride and Prejudice is the formula for the modern chick-flick.

 Overall this book was an entertaining exciting read where if you ignore the fictional world and its gaps, it was pretty good for about 3/4 of it. At first I was concerned since the first 80 pages or so reminded me of a retelling of The Giver. I found too many similarities in the plot that bothered me but eventually I overlooked that and enjoyed the quick fun read. 
 I have to admit I found Tris really dumb at times and would roll my eyes at parts so I am not too attached to her as a main character. 
 Reading along, I was hoping that this would be one of the first dystopian novels I would love - but then like all the other novels similar to this - the plot gets weird and force-fed to the reader. We happily follow a solid plot then it twists to something messed up AND just as we learn characters, the author kills them off. 
 I am still confused on how I feel about this book as I really enjoyed majority of it BUT I hope this isnt a series that gets even more messed up that completely derails."  # Generated from value "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read.

         hasContent "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency. 
 The book is turned out to be so effective. Whether it's the sympathy driven success since a young girl who seems to be very refine writer got snatched the right to flourish naturally. Or it is real good write up. 
 I liked it because my rational mind accepts it rather than the emotional part would be swayed away by the ordeal of the girl. 
 At the age of 13 she is reading mythology and studying different languages. Reading was such a heavy part of her life, and not some ordinary reading (language, philosophy etc). The way she endured pain during hiding, thought critically and drew opinions based on her knowledge, reviewing books in a context that was related to her ordeal/life is something I held on to very dearly while reading. She had a clear idea what she wanted to do once they finish the hiding (spending time in Germany and London to get education on history of arts, languages). Some of the ideas like, 'the old people supposed to be less confused since they dealt with the hard part already and have pretty much worked out their ways than the younger evolving youth' and 'when you are upset, instead of holding on to the people who are miserable since their misery can make you realize the blessings in your life, one should rely on the happiness and colours around' are quite fascinating. She use to go back to the old entries in diary and see her complaining self which she found as "ungrateful". 
 The end makes me wonder how terrified she must had felt when they were caught and above all how desperate she had been to leave her dear kitty behind. How she had lived the next 6-7 months without writing. Her intellectual self-had the need to shed itself. How she had kept insanity without talking to Kitty, since that was one major thing which kept her going. 
 Anyhow, in the end, Kitty did do justice by bringing Anne Frank to the world. Otherwise we would have never known the intelligent girl like many others who must had been lost in evil-selfish human warmongering conquests."  # Generated from value "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency.

How many young teenagers are so eloquent, so self-conscious, so tenacious and so aware of the people that surround them? Anne, at a very young age, managed not only to understand but also to express many human truths--truths that range from mundane topics such as everyday life and relationships and politics to topics that even some critical-thinking adults can't seem to grasp, like life and death, peace and war, depression and happiness. 
 Anne Frank achieved a lot. She sent a message to the World, a message that, if only half the people listened to, would make this a better place. Oh--but she could have achieved so much more.

 UGH. This one was the worst... 
 I honestly don't know why this book is so highly rated. This one was definitely the worst of the three. It was a complete repeat of book one. I liked the beginning where she was starting to get little hints and glimpses that there was a rebellion starting in some of the districts. That part was exciting and I wanted to watch more of that unfold, but before I knew it we were back in the God damned arena. And then it was exactly like the first book, people dying all over the place, alliances being formed, and knowing all along that she's going to figure some way out of there for her and Peeta. She kept rambling on about sacrificing herself for Peeta and her martyrdom was SO.FUCKING.ANNOYING. We all knew she and Peeta weren't going to die. There was so much "action" in this one that I didn't even get a chance to care about anyone else in the arena with her. So as people were dying, even ones in her alliance, I did not find myself caring all that much. Maybe I had resigned myself to the belief that they might all die (except Katniss and Peeta) so I didn't allow myself to get attached to any of them. 
 So my advice would be to skip a whole bunch of chapters until they figure out how to blow up the arena and then pick it back up there. Then it gets more interesting again. But I felt left out of the uprising, left out of the "Catching Fire" that was the title of the book. We see little glimpses and then by the time they get rescued it's all out war. We don't get to see how the action in the arena has influenced the people of the districts and the rebellion. So I thought it was a lot of lazy writing. A lot of missed opportunities by going back into the arena. It could have been so much better if Katniss and Peeta had been mentors to the games, and we could have been involved in the rebellion alliance and then we could have been a part of the arena AND been better positioned to get information of the districts' uprising. She could have formed many of the same bonds with the other past tributes by way of her tribute forming alliances with theirs. But I guess it's no good to dwell on all the ways you could have written a better sequel. Anywho I don't have a lot else to say about this one."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

I love too that defiance in the world of the hunger games is kindness and solidarity rather than blind self-interest and individualism. The whole series is a demented reversal of Gil Scot Heron's "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" in which the whole revolution is played out in hyperreality and simulacra, and not only the revolution, but the counter revolution will in fact be televised.

         hasContent "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it. This story that Collins has created, one about oppression and government control, rebellion and fighting for freedom, is so well done. There is never a dull moment. Everything that happens is happening for a reason, and the pacing is just perfect. 
 I know many people are upset that Katniss lost her "badassery-ness" from the first book, but really, this just made me connect with and understand her even more. What she went through in the first Games, and all the terrible stuff afterwards, is horrifying. Of course it's going to affect her. So many characters nowadays don't seem to feel anything - they just push away all the bad thoughts and keep fighting. They're kinda like Gale, in a way. Running on rage and not really taking in and dealing with all the bad. 
 Katniss isn't like that. What she went through, what she experienced, it affected her. It changed her. And that makes her character even more realistic. Friends were killed, she had to kill, she had to see the repercussions of her actions - these types of things affect you in ways you cannot imagine. She will never be just another girl from District 12. How could she be, after all she went through? 
 Collins has created a dynamic, complex cast of characters, and she is not afraid to kill them off. They are at war, after all. Death is to be expected. The only thing I'm not sure about is the last couple of chapters (not the epilogue). I like how everything resolved, just not sure in the way it resolved. But the more I think about it, the more I like it. Not a thing should be changed. 
 Also, I completely understand why Katniss did what she did, throughout the whole series. Any decisions she made, any actions she took, I understood her reasoning why, and almost always agreed with her. It's not easy to create a character in which readers truly understand, but Collins has done it here. She created a personality for Katniss that, while it did change based on what happened around her, the base of her character was always there. Splendid job in that regard. 
 Now, the epilogue. Maybe some people hate it, but honestly, I love it. It's so extremely powerful, and that last line? Yeah, that's a last sentence that I will always remember, word for word. It is the perfect way to end this series. Bravo, Suzanne Collins. Bravo. 
 *Even though I just finished re-reading the series, I could honestly start re-reading it all over again. That is how much I love this story. The Hunger Games is a series that I will definitely be re-reading over and over again in the future."  # Generated from value "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it.

         hasContent "** spoiler alert ** 
 Well that escalated quickly! This one was my favorite of the series.... 
 Talk about a 180! The last book was boring and unimpressive, people were dying everywhere but I didn't give a fuck. This one, just the opposite. Almost all of my favorite characters die. It was sad, it was painful, it had emotion. Raw, real, guttural emotion. 
 I thought Suzanne Collins painted a pretty good picture of war. Particularly that there are no winners in war. We are introduced to district thirteen and immediately made uncomfortable by their militarized governing. There are so many rules here that it's almost worse than living in the districts. Though no one is left to die in the streets the way they were in district 12, there are very few real freedoms here. There's definitely subtle (or maybe not so subtle) stabs at both extreme conservative capitalism (in Panem there's no regulation and no gov't assistance, it's every man for himself) and extreme communism (in district 13 everyone eats exactly the number of calories they need, and everyone wears the same clothes and is provided identical living quarters). Suzanne Collins artfully shows how both extremes lead back to the same tyranny and oppression. We wanted so desperately to believe that district 13 was some kind of utopia of freedom, but in their attempt to be the exact opposite of the capitol and everything it stood for, they turned themselves into the capitol. 
 We are also introduced to another leader of the people, Coin. Katniss isn't sure what to make of her and neither are we. I wish she had delved a little more completely into the corruption of power, because by the time we meet Coin we are already a little leery of her and her motivations. As the book goes on we get to see more and more that Coin is not a friend to Katniss and by the end we don't believe that Coin is going to be any better than Snow as a leader of Panem. I cheered when Katniss took her down. 
 Katniss was suffering from a clear case of PTSD throughout this book, and considering all she went through up until this book (and then a shit-ton more during this book!) she deserved to be a little out of sorts. It made her even more real than the first two books could have. She was vulnerable and unsure and not the picture of the rebellion that district thirteen wanted her to be. In some ways I was disappointed that she didn't take over the capitol herself, but in others I am really glad that she didn't. I hated that her sister died, but it was the perfect catalyst to bring Katniss to question what she was a part of. If her sister hadn't died, she wouldn't have been lead down the path of discovering just who Coin was and what she was capable of doing. I like that Katniss was a complete mess after it all went down. Like I said before, there are no winners in war."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

 OMG. Everyone loves Katniss and she has no idea why. I have no idea either.... 
 Okay, right off the bat I have to admit that the love triangle drove me absolutely crazy. Peeta or Gale? Who the fuck cares? BUT I can say that I thought there was care in how Suzanne Collins explained the Katniss love. I would have really rolled my eyes if Peeta had said "there's just something different about her." I thought it was much better to tell that his dad was in love with her mom and pointed Katniss out to Peeta when he was young. Also the dad showed Katniss special favor when she sold him her game. Okay, this makes it a more believable situation where she would catch Peeta's attention. The fact that her and Gale formed a bond naturally around hunting is passable too. But the whole best friend turned lover thing is tired and boring, but forgivable I guess. 
 NOW THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY... I do like the dystopian setting of this book. The way that the capitol keeps control of the country and the citizens through zero tolerance patriotism, and the yearly punishment of forcing children to fight to the death in an arena while the games are broadcast to the entire nation. Considering the premise I didn't think the book was quite as dark as I had expected. I am not sure what I expected, but I can see why this is still acceptable among YA readers. 
 I did take a little bit of issue with the arena ending. I read all three books before writing these reviews so I can see why they made the arena ending the way they did. BUT I also think that because they made such a big deal about people being drawn to the love story between Katniss and Peeta, that to take away their promise of two survivors and to force one of them to kill the other at the end of the games might have been enough to spark a rebellion anyway. 
 I had a love/hate relationship with Katniss as a character. I think in this book I mostly liked her. Though I thought she was immature at times I had to remind myself that she was only supposed to be 16 or 17 years old. I thought many elements of her character were overplayed stereotypes. The strong young girl who pays no attention to boys, and is temperamental and harsh but still manages to have two boys in love with her at the same time. Old and tired. Why can't she be those things MINUS the attention from boys. We don't need to teach our daughters that they are validated because someone loves them despite their being bitchy and off-putting. And she was kinda bitchy and off-putting. I suppose that isn't much different from a typical teenage girl in a lot of ways, but maybe if we rewarded our characters for kindness over aloofness we may influence our teens to be kinder and less aloof. Maybe not. But I digress... there were elements of her that were admirable. Her undying love and protection of her sister and her bond with Rue in the arena showed that she did have a softer, kinder side that she reserved for only a few. She had some character flaws and vulnerabilities which made her more realistic and likeable. I was drawn into her story and wanted to read on to the rest of the series to find out what happens with her."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man". But I recently came across Junot Diaz's reading list for his writing class and noticed "The Hunger Games" there. It sparked curiosity and an assumption that if the plot was cheesy, at least this story would be a good model for writing. Indeed, it is an excellent model. The story is well-paced, compelling, and full of content. At first I thought that the themes of trust and friendship would undergird all the action and page-turning suspense. Yet I was pleased to see the critical commentary on modern society that Collin's hit on, especially the disgusting effects of reality TV, namely the sick level of exploitation in entertainment and the lack of empathy from those who control and profit from the system. Also, I liked how, through Katniss, the author lays bare our sense of audience-- that the characters have no privacy and their lives are constantly broadcasted for public consumption. I think this is very relevant, especially for young readers, with the dominance of online social media. Nor does Collin's miss the opportunity to make subtle yet clear comments on classism and inequality between the Districts. The only criticism I have is that I did not really like the voice of the narrator. Katniss is not particularly endearing, but sharp and practical. The character even describes herself as coming across as "heartless." Perhaps-- as the traditional gender roles have been reversed-- this is part of her survival adaptation, and winning the games proves her tact correct. Overall, I was impressed with the layers of meaning in this YA novel and it's entertainment value, despite its already being a huge commercial success."  # Generated from value "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man".

 Also, haven seen the movie first, I loved how this book brought so much more to the story. The movie did a good job of being faithful to the story but the book adds so much more depth and detail that with both combined adds a fully amazing picture.

 4.5 out of 5 stars 
 SPOILERS! But really I doubt you haven't read it yet! 
 So how can I review a book that's been read by everyone and made into movies love by everyone? LIKE THIS 
 This book takes place in a dystopian American society. The country now has a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer districts that only exist to produce goods for the capital. This novel centers around Katniss, a girl from the coal mining district 12. She's very poor and has to provide for her family in order for them to survive. Also In this society every year the Capitol has a competition called The Hunger Games. In these games, teenagers from all twelve districts are picked from a "reaping" and forced to fight to the death in these games. This is because before this society was created, the districts tried to rebel against the capitol and reach independence. When they failed, the Hunger games were created as punishment. This year, Katniss' younger sister is chosen. Rather than watch her sister be killed, she volunteers to go to the games in her place. 
 Now here's what I liked. Katniss. I LOVE Katniss. She's strong, she's practical, and she breaks down every single trope of YA heroines that you can think of. The book is in her POV. Part of the fun of the book is getting inside her head to see how she strategizes and how she reacts to the cruelty of the games. I also liked how district life felt almost historical, like it took place in the past. Then we get to the Capitol and it feels like science fiction. Then when we get to the actual games it feels like a survival story. The fact that all the sub-genres are seamlessly woven together is what makes this book so fun to read. It was fast paced and had wonderful side characters as well. 
 Now here are some things I, not disliked, but kind of expected more of because of all the hype. First, Rue's death was a little anti-climactic. I expected it to have more of an impact on Katniss than it did. Another thing was Peeta. I spent most of the book thinking that , like Katniss, he was faking the whole being in love thing. But him really being in love with her felt a little unnecessary. At least in this book. I felt it might've fit in later books. And there was one thing I really didn't understand. WTF WERE THE WOLF PEOPLE? Were they just designed to look like the dead tributes? Or were they the dead tributes made into wolf people? I don't understand. 
 So there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been already said. I really enjoyed the book, I had to read it for an English class. Still haven't seen the movie, will watch it today probably. And I hope everyone else has read it and enjoyed it as much as I did."  # Generated from value "The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins

         hasContent "** spoiler alert ** 
 I finished reading Twilight today. Took me about a day to read as it is such a quick read. I'm sure you've all read this. I put it off as long as possible. 
 I have a friend who had never read the Harry Potter series. She promised me she would read it if I read the Twilight series, so here I am. 
 I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Did I enjoy this? For a young reader, yes. I think it's more suited for high schoolers and younger. For adults? Meh. Here's my thoughts 
 It's a love story with a vampire. The beginning I thought was cute as it brought back the fun innocence of a crush (I've been married for a while now so this was fun to relive). Ex. The excitement of simply being in the same room or standing next to a person. I found that enduring. But once they had kissed, I saw red flags. Edward never let her make decisions. He always was telling her what was best for her, despite her protests... but she doesn't fight him too hard. You'd think after a while she'd get fed up. I would. Edward also couldn't keep his story straight. Ex. "I promise I'll be with you for forever. You'll never be alone. I love you." Then a few paragraphs later we get "It's not safe for you to be with me. We shouldn't be together." This happens continually throughout the book. His wishy-washy back and forth attitude was so reminiscent of high school dating. (Hence why I felt this was suited for a younger audience - you know this is the drama they crave). {I'm not denying I was like this. It's just obnoxious now} 
 Now Jacob. He wasn't in it too much. However, he actually asked and listened to what's Bella wanted. And he complimented her (Edward didn't always return compliments). And he made her relax. I also hated how he grew exponentially while she was away (she came back and he's 6'2"). I don't know of anyone who has a growth spurt that extreme. 
 I don't know which team I'm on yet as this first book doesn't really present you with an either-or conundrum. It was all about Bella and Edward. So I remain neutral. 
 Lastly, they left a loose end that bothered me. Bella calls her mom and leaves a voicemail frantically asking her to call before returning home. It turns out the bad guy intercepted it and responded. However, after he dies, mom shows up at the hospital to see Bella and never once mentions the voicemail. There's no way she wouldn't have called her moms cell phone. I know cell phones existed in this story because Bella used one to call her mom. And if she knew her mom wasn't home, why leave a message on a home message machine (plus - who even had those anymore?). So... mom should've clued in to the crazy that was going down in Phoenix. That bugged me. 
 Alright your Twilight fans. Do your worst. Tear me apart."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere. Girl meets boy. Boy barely manages to avoid eating girl. Boy and girl fall in love with each other. Boy stalks girl. Girl's okay with that. Boy probably won't kill girl, but he's making no promises. It's got a lot I like in a book passionate, chaste love-triangle-free romance (for the most part, if you stick to the first book); fantasy with a new perspective; excitement; a lot of pages. It's also repetitive, problematic, badly written. I was pretty surprised to see that I for the first time I couldn't enjoy it as much as before. Largely because for the first time, I read Edward as having no redeeming qualities. 
 Edward Cullen is cold. I'm not talking about his stone lips. I never realized before how mean and uncaring he is. Anytime Bella is uncomfortable or unhappy, he's laughing at her. Intellectually, I knew that the Edward/Bella relationship is abusive and controlling. But I didn't realize how much Edward uses that awful put-the-girl-down-to-make-her-like-you technique. Ugh. Edward Cullen is definitely not what Twilight has going for it. 
 Here's where Twilight's strengths are: The romantic/sexual tension in this book is largely very good. While I didn't find the meadow scene particularly compelling this go around, the build up to the first kiss is excellent. 
 The book really feels like two different books. The first chapter through the baseball scene, plus the epilogue feel like one book, while the prologue and baseball scene to the last chapter has a totally different tone. While somewhat suspenseful, the first portion is a meandering romance, while the latter portion feels like a somewhat dull thriller. 
 Overall, I wouldn't stop recommending this to fans of romance who can handle cheese. Although a handout identifying warning signs of abusive relationships nearby on the shelf wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm sure it's not my last reread, either. 
 Why people turn on Twilight: 
 -embarrassment because/ feeling of betrayal that they had liked Edward 
 -Breaking Dawn There are so many things embarrassingly much worse about that book compared to the rest of the series. It breaks all the rules of the world that have been set up previously. Everything about Renesmee from her name to existence is ridiculous. And things with Jacob get very squicky. 
 -because it inspires feverous praise, and then later people are embarrassed they praised it so much when they realize how flawed its writing/romance is 
 -because it's just plain kind of embarrassingly cheesy"  # Generated from value "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere.

         hasContent "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still. As hard as it may be to fathom this, I didn't know anything about the novel other than its Great Depression, Deep South setting. It is certainly eye opening today to hear the liberal use of racial epithets (the N word most notably) although it is certainly in keeping with the times and the location. 
 As much as I am fighting against it, I am a literary philistine when it comes to classic fiction. I spend most of my leisure reading time on non-fiction of all types so my reviews and ratings are often filtered through that lens. I very much enjoyed this novel, speaking as it does to the vile force that was and is racism in this country. Atticus Finch is certainly a worthy hero and I can see why this book is often taught in schools, despite the racism that is front and center. Atticus' attitude and belief system is admirable and his integrity shines through the whole narrative. His is certainly an attitude to life worth emulating. 
 The plot is not complex, taking place over three years but the racial themes, the loss of innocence, the lack of real justice and the humanity that runs through the narrator's father certainly make it pretty gripping reading. I am glad I read it and feel better informed, in my own small way, on a subject that is viscerally important to my liberal, bleeding heart!"  # Generated from value "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still.

 Angels & Demons... 
 This Dan Brown should be proud of himself...really. 
 This book and Da Vinci Code got me thinking...who the hell Dan Brown is. What is his academic background? I guess if the Illuminati ever came back to life and intended the wipe out Catholicism, they would drain their brains as they might but they wouldn't be able to come up with a plot as perfect and devilish as that of Dan Brown. This guy knows more than professors of history, physicists and religion men do; or at least he is a damn good researcher with an exceptional knowledge of rare fields like symbology and cryptography and a deep understanding of art, history and religions. It takes a smart professor of symbology to solve the riddles in the novel, but it takes a genius writer to create these riddles in the first place. Dan Brown is a genius. He really is. The air of mystery and apprehension in the novel is masterfully crafted that it engrossed me even when I off the book. I have to admit, I suspected all the characters. I suspected ALL of them except Langdon and Vittoria. I had to keep a computer close by so that every now and then I'd check google and youtube on scientific terms and historical facts. For me, this novel was not just a book; it was a whole experience. 
 Five stars...Yes. I fully enjoyed it... it is fairly long but you wouldn't wish it to end. My impression is mainly positive except for two points. The work as a whole deserves 5 stars nonetheless. 
 What I have to comment on rather than criticism is (spoilers coming ahead) 1) the Hassassin; the stereotypical sex-crazy terrorist barbaric Muslim Arab! Being a Muslim Arab, I felt offended. Plus... Come one Dan Brown, I guess you know better. The Hassassins, though considered a Shittii sect, were not at all religious. So I doubt that their descendants would in any way hold grudges against the church for sending the Crusaders centuries ago. And the few Arabic words the guy used - just to sound Arab - are of the Egyptian Dialect, while the Hassassins descendants, if any, would never be Egyptians. This might sound trivial (and this is why I didn't let this point affect my review) but the second point... I guess the director of the film version of the book would agree with me ... has to do with logic of events. Spinning over 128 chapters, the story was about a plot masterminded and carried out by a secret society; the Illuminati are many; they infiltrate organizations and hence, they are capable of carrying out an attack with the scale of that described in the novel; they can infiltrate the CERN, the Vatican; church, archives; monuments and all, the can infiltrate the Swiss Guard and the Vatican Police. This I understand. But reaching the end (folded in ONLY 9 chapters out of 137), it turned out that the whole plot was the work of a single guy! He is powerful; but he is one still. He imagined the full scenario and he had motives (a little bit overrated - but I think the author is implying that he was psychologically troubled). But when I tried to reconstruct the story from the new view point (that the camerlengo was the one behind the whole thing because he believed that the popessssss are not truly faithful to God), I had many questions that I couldn't find answers to; How did he recruit the Hassassin? Really? He did the whole thing in less then a month. How did he get that illuminati Muslim Arab Hassassin and convinced him to carry this out in revenge for his ancestors? In the film, the assassin did it for money, which was logical. But in the novel? It was all out of faith and loyalty. 2) How did he infiltrate the the CERN? Money? Maybe ..it just needed to be made clear. Guess to my humble mind, this is a very difficult fortress to break into. And finally, when the Hassassin called in the camerlengo's office, did he not recognize the guy's voice, since their relationship was only telephonic? Should I comment on Langdon's surviving a 3 mile fall from the helicopter? No, I won't. I still enjoyed the book greatly and still recommend it to everyone."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book. I downloaded the audio version to pass the time on a trip. Although initially skeptical of the five factions set up as being too obvious a metaphor for high school cliques...but I really connected with Tris' journey from Abnegnation to Dauntless. The struggle to form an identity, and how the faction she rejections continued to define her...and how living in the space between factions was seen as dangerous resonated with my religious journey. The only real downside for me was the villians. I felt that the motivations of enemy faction were rather plastic and cartoonish. But I was still impressed enough that I will have to read the next book."  # Generated from value "I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book.

         hasContent "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read. My thoughts after reading this? I am still not sure... 
 Overall this book was an entertaining exciting read where if you ignore the fictional world and its gaps, it was pretty good for about 3/4 of it. At first I was concerned since the first 80 pages or so reminded me of a retelling of The Giver. I found too many similarities in the plot that bothered me but eventually I overlooked that and enjoyed the quick fun read. 
 I have to admit I found Tris really dumb at times and would roll my eyes at parts so I am not too attached to her as a main character. 
 Reading along, I was hoping that this would be one of the first dystopian novels I would love - but then like all the other novels similar to this - the plot gets weird and force-fed to the reader. We happily follow a solid plot then it twists to something messed up AND just as we learn characters, the author kills them off. 
 I am still confused on how I feel about this book as I really enjoyed majority of it BUT I hope this isnt a series that gets even more messed up that completely derails."  # Generated from value "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read.

You've got the girl that ends up being a bad ass "chosen-one," you got a teenage forbidden romance, you've got the classic bad guy, a little loyalty, a little betrayal, and a lot of action. The premise seemed a little manufactured. Perhaps it would be appropriate to call the author of this book "Dr. Frankenstein" as she seems to create a story from plots found in the dystopian futuristic graveyard. Oddly enough, despite the cookie cutter premise, I really enjoyed reading this book. It it's the ground running and drags you along whether you want to or not. Would recommend if you liked The Maze Runner, Hunger Games, Cinder, Mortal Instruments, Harry Potter, Unwind etc."  # Generated from value "If books were food, Divergent would be dessert.

         hasContent "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency. 
 The book is turned out to be so effective. Whether it's the sympathy driven success since a young girl who seems to be very refine writer got snatched the right to flourish naturally. Or it is real good write up. 
 I liked it because my rational mind accepts it rather than the emotional part would be swayed away by the ordeal of the girl. 
 At the age of 13 she is reading mythology and studying different languages. Reading was such a heavy part of her life, and not some ordinary reading (language, philosophy etc). The way she endured pain during hiding, thought critically and drew opinions based on her knowledge, reviewing books in a context that was related to her ordeal/life is something I held on to very dearly while reading. She had a clear idea what she wanted to do once they finish the hiding (spending time in Germany and London to get education on history of arts, languages). Some of the ideas like, 'the old people supposed to be less confused since they dealt with the hard part already and have pretty much worked out their ways than the younger evolving youth' and 'when you are upset, instead of holding on to the people who are miserable since their misery can make you realize the blessings in your life, one should rely on the happiness and colours around' are quite fascinating. She use to go back to the old entries in diary and see her complaining self which she found as "ungrateful". 
 The end makes me wonder how terrified she must had felt when they were caught and above all how desperate she had been to leave her dear kitty behind. How she had lived the next 6-7 months without writing. Her intellectual self-had the need to shed itself. How she had kept insanity without talking to Kitty, since that was one major thing which kept her going. 
 Anyhow, in the end, Kitty did do justice by bringing Anne Frank to the world. Otherwise we would have never known the intelligent girl like many others who must had been lost in evil-selfish human warmongering conquests."  # Generated from value "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency.

Anne, at a very young age, managed not only to understand but also to express many human truths--truths that range from mundane topics such as everyday life and relationships and politics to topics that even some critical-thinking adults can't seem to grasp, like life and death, peace and war, depression and happiness. 
 Anne Frank achieved a lot. She sent a message to the World, a message that, if only half the people listened to, would make this a better place. Oh--but she could have achieved so much more.

 UGH. This one was the worst... 
 I honestly don't know why this book is so highly rated. This one was definitely the worst of the three. It was a complete repeat of book one. I liked the beginning where she was starting to get little hints and glimpses that there was a rebellion starting in some of the districts. That part was exciting and I wanted to watch more of that unfold, but before I knew it we were back in the God damned arena. And then it was exactly like the first book, people dying all over the place, alliances being formed, and knowing all along that she's going to figure some way out of there for her and Peeta. She kept rambling on about sacrificing herself for Peeta and her martyrdom was SO.FUCKING.ANNOYING. We all knew she and Peeta weren't going to die. There was so much "action" in this one that I didn't even get a chance to care about anyone else in the arena with her. So as people were dying, even ones in her alliance, I did not find myself caring all that much. Maybe I had resigned myself to the belief that they might all die (except Katniss and Peeta) so I didn't allow myself to get attached to any of them. 
 So my advice would be to skip a whole bunch of chapters until they figure out how to blow up the arena and then pick it back up there. Then it gets more interesting again. But I felt left out of the uprising, left out of the "Catching Fire" that was the title of the book. We see little glimpses and then by the time they get rescued it's all out war. We don't get to see how the action in the arena has influenced the people of the districts and the rebellion. So I thought it was a lot of lazy writing. A lot of missed opportunities by going back into the arena. It could have been so much better if Katniss and Peeta had been mentors to the games, and we could have been involved in the rebellion alliance and then we could have been a part of the arena AND been better positioned to get information of the districts' uprising. She could have formed many of the same bonds with the other past tributes by way of her tribute forming alliances with theirs. But I guess it's no good to dwell on all the ways you could have written a better sequel. Anywho I don't have a lot else to say about this one."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "These books are way more subversive and dark than Harry Potter! Was I born in the wrong era in terms of wildly popular nerdy book trends? Perhaps so, because Katniss is so cool, with her proto-Artemis/Diana quiver and arrows, and her disdain for leg-shaving and desire to just live alone. I love too that defiance in the world of the hunger games is kindness and solidarity rather than blind self-interest and individualism. The whole series is a demented reversal of Gil Scot Heron's "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" in which the whole revolution is played out in hyperreality and simulacra, and not only the revolution, but the counter revolution will in fact be televised. 
 Also, isn't anyone bothered that time and time again in the books everyone in District 11 is described as "olive" skinned and... Jennifer Lawrence? Really?"  # Generated from value "These books are way more subversive and dark than Harry Potter! Was I born in the wrong era in terms of wildly popular nerdy book trends?

         hasContent "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it. This story that Collins has created, one about oppression and government control, rebellion and fighting for freedom, is so well done. There is never a dull moment. Everything that happens is happening for a reason, and the pacing is just perfect. 
 I know many people are upset that Katniss lost her "badassery-ness" from the first book, but really, this just made me connect with and understand her even more. What she went through in the first Games, and all the terrible stuff afterwards, is horrifying. Of course it's going to affect her. So many characters nowadays don't seem to feel anything - they just push away all the bad thoughts and keep fighting. They're kinda like Gale, in a way. Running on rage and not really taking in and dealing with all the bad. 
 Katniss isn't like that. What she went through, what she experienced, it affected her. It changed her. And that makes her character even more realistic. Friends were killed, she had to kill, she had to see the repercussions of her actions - these types of things affect you in ways you cannot imagine. She will never be just another girl from District 12. How could she be, after all she went through? 
 Collins has created a dynamic, complex cast of characters, and she is not afraid to kill them off. They are at war, after all. Death is to be expected. The only thing I'm not sure about is the last couple of chapters (not the epilogue). I like how everything resolved, just not sure in the way it resolved. But the more I think about it, the more I like it. Not a thing should be changed. 
 Also, I completely understand why Katniss did what she did, throughout the whole series. Any decisions she made, any actions she took, I understood her reasoning why, and almost always agreed with her. It's not easy to create a character in which readers truly understand, but Collins has done it here. She created a personality for Katniss that, while it did change based on what happened around her, the base of her character was always there. Splendid job in that regard. 
 Now, the epilogue. Maybe some people hate it, but honestly, I love it. It's so extremely powerful, and that last line? Yeah, that's a last sentence that I will always remember, word for word. It is the perfect way to end this series. Bravo, Suzanne Collins. Bravo. 
 *Even though I just finished re-reading the series, I could honestly start re-reading it all over again. That is how much I love this story. The Hunger Games is a series that I will definitely be re-reading over and over again in the future."  # Generated from value "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it.

 Well that escalated quickly! This one was my favorite of the series.... 
 Talk about a 180! The last book was boring and unimpressive, people were dying everywhere but I didn't give a fuck. This one, just the opposite. Almost all of my favorite characters die. It was sad, it was painful, it had emotion. Raw, real, guttural emotion. 
 I thought Suzanne Collins painted a pretty good picture of war. Particularly that there are no winners in war. We are introduced to district thirteen and immediately made uncomfortable by their militarized governing. There are so many rules here that it's almost worse than living in the districts. Though no one is left to die in the streets the way they were in district 12, there are very few real freedoms here. There's definitely subtle (or maybe not so subtle) stabs at both extreme conservative capitalism (in Panem there's no regulation and no gov't assistance, it's every man for himself) and extreme communism (in district 13 everyone eats exactly the number of calories they need, and everyone wears the same clothes and is provided identical living quarters). Suzanne Collins artfully shows how both extremes lead back to the same tyranny and oppression. We wanted so desperately to believe that district 13 was some kind of utopia of freedom, but in their attempt to be the exact opposite of the capitol and everything it stood for, they turned themselves into the capitol. 
 We are also introduced to another leader of the people, Coin. Katniss isn't sure what to make of her and neither are we. I wish she had delved a little more completely into the corruption of power, because by the time we meet Coin we are already a little leery of her and her motivations. As the book goes on we get to see more and more that Coin is not a friend to Katniss and by the end we don't believe that Coin is going to be any better than Snow as a leader of Panem. I cheered when Katniss took her down. 
 Katniss was suffering from a clear case of PTSD throughout this book, and considering all she went through up until this book (and then a shit-ton more during this book!) she deserved to be a little out of sorts. It made her even more real than the first two books could have. She was vulnerable and unsure and not the picture of the rebellion that district thirteen wanted her to be. In some ways I was disappointed that she didn't take over the capitol herself, but in others I am really glad that she didn't. I hated that her sister died, but it was the perfect catalyst to bring Katniss to question what she was a part of. If her sister hadn't died, she wouldn't have been lead down the path of discovering just who Coin was and what she was capable of doing. I like that Katniss was a complete mess after it all went down. Like I said before, there are no winners in war."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

 OMG. Everyone loves Katniss and she has no idea why. I have no idea either.... 
 Okay, right off the bat I have to admit that the love triangle drove me absolutely crazy. Peeta or Gale? Who the fuck cares? BUT I can say that I thought there was care in how Suzanne Collins explained the Katniss love. I would have really rolled my eyes if Peeta had said "there's just something different about her." I thought it was much better to tell that his dad was in love with her mom and pointed Katniss out to Peeta when he was young. Also the dad showed Katniss special favor when she sold him her game. Okay, this makes it a more believable situation where she would catch Peeta's attention. The fact that her and Gale formed a bond naturally around hunting is passable too. But the whole best friend turned lover thing is tired and boring, but forgivable I guess. 
 NOW THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY... I do like the dystopian setting of this book. The way that the capitol keeps control of the country and the citizens through zero tolerance patriotism, and the yearly punishment of forcing children to fight to the death in an arena while the games are broadcast to the entire nation. Considering the premise I didn't think the book was quite as dark as I had expected. I am not sure what I expected, but I can see why this is still acceptable among YA readers. 
 I did take a little bit of issue with the arena ending. I read all three books before writing these reviews so I can see why they made the arena ending the way they did. BUT I also think that because they made such a big deal about people being drawn to the love story between Katniss and Peeta, that to take away their promise of two survivors and to force one of them to kill the other at the end of the games might have been enough to spark a rebellion anyway. 
 I had a love/hate relationship with Katniss as a character. I think in this book I mostly liked her. Though I thought she was immature at times I had to remind myself that she was only supposed to be 16 or 17 years old. I thought many elements of her character were overplayed stereotypes. The strong young girl who pays no attention to boys, and is temperamental and harsh but still manages to have two boys in love with her at the same time. Old and tired. Why can't she be those things MINUS the attention from boys. We don't need to teach our daughters that they are validated because someone loves them despite their being bitchy and off-putting. And she was kinda bitchy and off-putting. I suppose that isn't much different from a typical teenage girl in a lot of ways, but maybe if we rewarded our characters for kindness over aloofness we may influence our teens to be kinder and less aloof. Maybe not. But I digress... there were elements of her that were admirable. Her undying love and protection of her sister and her bond with Rue in the arena showed that she did have a softer, kinder side that she reserved for only a few. She had some character flaws and vulnerabilities which made her more realistic and likeable. I was drawn into her story and wanted to read on to the rest of the series to find out what happens with her."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man". But I recently came across Junot Diaz's reading list for his writing class and noticed "The Hunger Games" there. It sparked curiosity and an assumption that if the plot was cheesy, at least this story would be a good model for writing. Indeed, it is an excellent model. The story is well-paced, compelling, and full of content. At first I thought that the themes of trust and friendship would undergird all the action and page-turning suspense. Yet I was pleased to see the critical commentary on modern society that Collin's hit on, especially the disgusting effects of reality TV, namely the sick level of exploitation in entertainment and the lack of empathy from those who control and profit from the system. Also, I liked how, through Katniss, the author lays bare our sense of audience-- that the characters have no privacy and their lives are constantly broadcasted for public consumption. I think this is very relevant, especially for young readers, with the dominance of online social media. Nor does Collin's miss the opportunity to make subtle yet clear comments on classism and inequality between the Districts. The only criticism I have is that I did not really like the voice of the narrator. Katniss is not particularly endearing, but sharp and practical. The character even describes herself as coming across as "heartless." Perhaps-- as the traditional gender roles have been reversed-- this is part of her survival adaptation, and winning the games proves her tact correct. Overall, I was impressed with the layers of meaning in this YA novel and it's entertainment value, despite its already being a huge commercial success."  # Generated from value "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man".

 4.5 out of 5 stars 
 SPOILERS! But really I doubt you haven't read it yet! 
 So how can I review a book that's been read by everyone and made into movies love by everyone? LIKE THIS 
 This book takes place in a dystopian American society. The country now has a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer districts that only exist to produce goods for the capital. This novel centers around Katniss, a girl from the coal mining district 12. She's very poor and has to provide for her family in order for them to survive. Also In this society every year the Capitol has a competition called The Hunger Games. In these games, teenagers from all twelve districts are picked from a "reaping" and forced to fight to the death in these games. This is because before this society was created, the districts tried to rebel against the capitol and reach independence. When they failed, the Hunger games were created as punishment. This year, Katniss' younger sister is chosen. Rather than watch her sister be killed, she volunteers to go to the games in her place. 
 Now here's what I liked. Katniss. I LOVE Katniss. She's strong, she's practical, and she breaks down every single trope of YA heroines that you can think of. The book is in her POV. Part of the fun of the book is getting inside her head to see how she strategizes and how she reacts to the cruelty of the games. I also liked how district life felt almost historical, like it took place in the past. Then we get to the Capitol and it feels like science fiction. Then when we get to the actual games it feels like a survival story. The fact that all the sub-genres are seamlessly woven together is what makes this book so fun to read. It was fast paced and had wonderful side characters as well. 
 Now here are some things I, not disliked, but kind of expected more of because of all the hype. First, Rue's death was a little anti-climactic. I expected it to have more of an impact on Katniss than it did. Another thing was Peeta. I spent most of the book thinking that , like Katniss, he was faking the whole being in love thing. But him really being in love with her felt a little unnecessary. At least in this book. I felt it might've fit in later books. And there was one thing I really didn't understand. WTF WERE THE WOLF PEOPLE? Were they just designed to look like the dead tributes? Or were they the dead tributes made into wolf people? I don't understand. 
 So there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been already said. I really enjoyed the book, I had to read it for an English class. Still haven't seen the movie, will watch it today probably. And I hope everyone else has read it and enjoyed it as much as I did."  # Generated from value "The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins

 I finished reading Twilight today. Took me about a day to read as it is such a quick read. I'm sure you've all read this. I put it off as long as possible. 
 I have a friend who had never read the Harry Potter series. She promised me she would read it if I read the Twilight series, so here I am. 
 I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Did I enjoy this? For a young reader, yes. I think it's more suited for high schoolers and younger. For adults? Meh. Here's my thoughts 
 It's a love story with a vampire. The beginning I thought was cute as it brought back the fun innocence of a crush (I've been married for a while now so this was fun to relive). Ex. The excitement of simply being in the same room or standing next to a person. I found that enduring. But once they had kissed, I saw red flags. Edward never let her make decisions. He always was telling her what was best for her, despite her protests... but she doesn't fight him too hard. You'd think after a while she'd get fed up. I would. Edward also couldn't keep his story straight. Ex. "I promise I'll be with you for forever. You'll never be alone. I love you." Then a few paragraphs later we get "It's not safe for you to be with me. We shouldn't be together." This happens continually throughout the book. His wishy-washy back and forth attitude was so reminiscent of high school dating. (Hence why I felt this was suited for a younger audience - you know this is the drama they crave). {I'm not denying I was like this. It's just obnoxious now} 
 Now Jacob. He wasn't in it too much. However, he actually asked and listened to what's Bella wanted. And he complimented her (Edward didn't always return compliments). And he made her relax. I also hated how he grew exponentially while she was away (she came back and he's 6'2"). I don't know of anyone who has a growth spurt that extreme. 
 I don't know which team I'm on yet as this first book doesn't really present you with an either-or conundrum. It was all about Bella and Edward. So I remain neutral. 
 Lastly, they left a loose end that bothered me. Bella calls her mom and leaves a voicemail frantically asking her to call before returning home. It turns out the bad guy intercepted it and responded. However, after he dies, mom shows up at the hospital to see Bella and never once mentions the voicemail. There's no way she wouldn't have called her moms cell phone. I know cell phones existed in this story because Bella used one to call her mom. And if she knew her mom wasn't home, why leave a message on a home message machine (plus - who even had those anymore?). So... mom should've clued in to the crazy that was going down in Phoenix. That bugged me. 
 Alright your Twilight fans. Do your worst. Tear me apart."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

I also hated how he grew exponentially while she was away (she came back and he's 6'2"). I don't know of anyone who has a growth spurt that extreme. 
 I don't know which team I'm on yet as this first book doesn't really present you with an either-or conundrum. It was all about Bella and Edward. So I remain neutral. 
 Lastly, they left a loose end that bothered me. Bella calls her mom and leaves a voicemail frantically asking her to call before returning home. It turns out the bad guy intercepted it and responded. However, after he dies, mom shows up at the hospital to see Bella and never once mentions the voicemail. There's no way she wouldn't have called her moms cell phone. I know cell phones existed in this story because Bella used one to call her mom. And if she knew her mom wasn't home, why leave a message on a home message machine (plus - who even had those anymore?). So... mom should've clued in to the crazy that was going down in Phoenix. That bugged me. 
 Alright your Twilight fans. Do your worst. Tear me apart." located at cell 'reviews'!E12.,

         hasContent "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere. Girl meets boy. Boy barely manages to avoid eating girl. Boy and girl fall in love with each other. Boy stalks girl. Girl's okay with that. Boy probably won't kill girl, but he's making no promises. It's got a lot I like in a book passionate, chaste love-triangle-free romance (for the most part, if you stick to the first book); fantasy with a new perspective; excitement; a lot of pages. It's also repetitive, problematic, badly written. I was pretty surprised to see that I for the first time I couldn't enjoy it as much as before. Largely because for the first time, I read Edward as having no redeeming qualities. 
 Edward Cullen is cold. I'm not talking about his stone lips. I never realized before how mean and uncaring he is. Anytime Bella is uncomfortable or unhappy, he's laughing at her. Intellectually, I knew that the Edward/Bella relationship is abusive and controlling. But I didn't realize how much Edward uses that awful put-the-girl-down-to-make-her-like-you technique. Ugh. Edward Cullen is definitely not what Twilight has going for it. 
 Here's where Twilight's strengths are: The romantic/sexual tension in this book is largely very good. While I didn't find the meadow scene particularly compelling this go around, the build up to the first kiss is excellent. 
 The book really feels like two different books. The first chapter through the baseball scene, plus the epilogue feel like one book, while the prologue and baseball scene to the last chapter has a totally different tone. While somewhat suspenseful, the first portion is a meandering romance, while the latter portion feels like a somewhat dull thriller. 
 Overall, I wouldn't stop recommending this to fans of romance who can handle cheese. Although a handout identifying warning signs of abusive relationships nearby on the shelf wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm sure it's not my last reread, either. 
 Why people turn on Twilight: 
 -embarrassment because/ feeling of betrayal that they had liked Edward 
 -Breaking Dawn There are so many things embarrassingly much worse about that book compared to the rest of the series. It breaks all the rules of the world that have been set up previously. Everything about Renesmee from her name to existence is ridiculous. And things with Jacob get very squicky. 
 -because it inspires feverous praise, and then later people are embarrassed they praised it so much when they realize how flawed its writing/romance is 
 -because it's just plain kind of embarrassingly cheesy"  # Generated from value "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere.

         hasContent "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still. As hard as it may be to fathom this, I didn't know anything about the novel other than its Great Depression, Deep South setting. It is certainly eye opening today to hear the liberal use of racial epithets (the N word most notably) although it is certainly in keeping with the times and the location. 
 As much as I am fighting against it, I am a literary philistine when it comes to classic fiction. I spend most of my leisure reading time on non-fiction of all types so my reviews and ratings are often filtered through that lens. I very much enjoyed this novel, speaking as it does to the vile force that was and is racism in this country. Atticus Finch is certainly a worthy hero and I can see why this book is often taught in schools, despite the racism that is front and center. Atticus' attitude and belief system is admirable and his integrity shines through the whole narrative. His is certainly an attitude to life worth emulating. 
 The plot is not complex, taking place over three years but the racial themes, the loss of innocence, the lack of real justice and the humanity that runs through the narrator's father certainly make it pretty gripping reading. I am glad I read it and feel better informed, in my own small way, on a subject that is viscerally important to my liberal, bleeding heart!"  # Generated from value "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still.

 Angels & Demons... 
 This Dan Brown should be proud of himself...really. 
 This book and Da Vinci Code got me thinking...who the hell Dan Brown is. What is his academic background? I guess if the Illuminati ever came back to life and intended the wipe out Catholicism, they would drain their brains as they might but they wouldn't be able to come up with a plot as perfect and devilish as that of Dan Brown. This guy knows more than professors of history, physicists and religion men do; or at least he is a damn good researcher with an exceptional knowledge of rare fields like symbology and cryptography and a deep understanding of art, history and religions. It takes a smart professor of symbology to solve the riddles in the novel, but it takes a genius writer to create these riddles in the first place. Dan Brown is a genius. He really is. The air of mystery and apprehension in the novel is masterfully crafted that it engrossed me even when I off the book. I have to admit, I suspected all the characters. I suspected ALL of them except Langdon and Vittoria. I had to keep a computer close by so that every now and then I'd check google and youtube on scientific terms and historical facts. For me, this novel was not just a book; it was a whole experience. 
 Five stars...Yes. I fully enjoyed it... it is fairly long but you wouldn't wish it to end. My impression is mainly positive except for two points. The work as a whole deserves 5 stars nonetheless. 
 What I have to comment on rather than criticism is (spoilers coming ahead) 1) the Hassassin; the stereotypical sex-crazy terrorist barbaric Muslim Arab! Being a Muslim Arab, I felt offended. Plus... Come one Dan Brown, I guess you know better. The Hassassins, though considered a Shittii sect, were not at all religious. So I doubt that their descendants would in any way hold grudges against the church for sending the Crusaders centuries ago. And the few Arabic words the guy used - just to sound Arab - are of the Egyptian Dialect, while the Hassassins descendants, if any, would never be Egyptians. This might sound trivial (and this is why I didn't let this point affect my review) but the second point... I guess the director of the film version of the book would agree with me ... has to do with logic of events. Spinning over 128 chapters, the story was about a plot masterminded and carried out by a secret society; the Illuminati are many; they infiltrate organizations and hence, they are capable of carrying out an attack with the scale of that described in the novel; they can infiltrate the CERN, the Vatican; church, archives; monuments and all, the can infiltrate the Swiss Guard and the Vatican Police. This I understand. But reaching the end (folded in ONLY 9 chapters out of 137), it turned out that the whole plot was the work of a single guy! He is powerful; but he is one still. He imagined the full scenario and he had motives (a little bit overrated - but I think the author is implying that he was psychologically troubled). But when I tried to reconstruct the story from the new view point (that the camerlengo was the one behind the whole thing because he believed that the popessssss are not truly faithful to God), I had many questions that I couldn't find answers to; How did he recruit the Hassassin? Really? He did the whole thing in less then a month. How did he get that illuminati Muslim Arab Hassassin and convinced him to carry this out in revenge for his ancestors? In the film, the assassin did it for money, which was logical. But in the novel? It was all out of faith and loyalty. 2) How did he infiltrate the the CERN? Money? Maybe ..it just needed to be made clear. Guess to my humble mind, this is a very difficult fortress to break into. And finally, when the Hassassin called in the camerlengo's office, did he not recognize the guy's voice, since their relationship was only telephonic? Should I comment on Langdon's surviving a 3 mile fall from the helicopter? No, I won't. I still enjoyed the book greatly and still recommend it to everyone."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

So far 2017 has been a disappointing 8 months until now. I am so in love with EVERYTHING about this book (and am so happy I finally got round to it; it has been on my reading list for years). 
 I am currently making my way through "The Complete Novels of Jane Austen" (all 1278 pages of it) and Pride and Prejudice is book 2 of 7. Sense and Sensibility was first and although I appreciated Austen's humour and writing, I was not a fan of this novel. 
 So imagine my sheer delight when I loved P&P from page 1. There is laugh-out-loud humour, scandal, insufferable characters, loveable characters, and of course romance. I loved the way Austen developed the characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet who I see to be intelligent and smart, full of integrity, and quite the feminist.

A man and a woman who have no chance of being together, and for most of the story do not even like each other, find themselves drawn in more and more by each other and in the end live happily ever after. It is an overused premise nowadays, but I do have to give credit to Jane Austen seeing as she wrote it in 1813 and its basic plot structure has been copied a million different times, just proves her genius. I thought it also cleverly makes fun of the ridiculous social constructs of the time and the manner in which people are expected to address one another. This last point can get lost in the old English writing"  # Generated from value "Pride and Prejudice is the formula for the modern chick-flick.

 Overall this book was an entertaining exciting read where if you ignore the fictional world and its gaps, it was pretty good for about 3/4 of it. At first I was concerned since the first 80 pages or so reminded me of a retelling of The Giver. I found too many similarities in the plot that bothered me but eventually I overlooked that and enjoyed the quick fun read. 
 I have to admit I found Tris really dumb at times and would roll my eyes at parts so I am not too attached to her as a main character. 
 Reading along, I was hoping that this would be one of the first dystopian novels I would love - but then like all the other novels similar to this - the plot gets weird and force-fed to the reader. We happily follow a solid plot then it twists to something messed up AND just as we learn characters, the author kills them off. 
 I am still confused on how I feel about this book as I really enjoyed majority of it BUT I hope this isnt a series that gets even more messed up that completely derails."  # Generated from value "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read.

         hasContent "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency. 
 The book is turned out to be so effective. Whether it's the sympathy driven success since a young girl who seems to be very refine writer got snatched the right to flourish naturally. Or it is real good write up. 
 I liked it because my rational mind accepts it rather than the emotional part would be swayed away by the ordeal of the girl. 
 At the age of 13 she is reading mythology and studying different languages. Reading was such a heavy part of her life, and not some ordinary reading (language, philosophy etc). The way she endured pain during hiding, thought critically and drew opinions based on her knowledge, reviewing books in a context that was related to her ordeal/life is something I held on to very dearly while reading. She had a clear idea what she wanted to do once they finish the hiding (spending time in Germany and London to get education on history of arts, languages). Some of the ideas like, 'the old people supposed to be less confused since they dealt with the hard part already and have pretty much worked out their ways than the younger evolving youth' and 'when you are upset, instead of holding on to the people who are miserable since their misery can make you realize the blessings in your life, one should rely on the happiness and colours around' are quite fascinating. She use to go back to the old entries in diary and see her complaining self which she found as "ungrateful". 
 The end makes me wonder how terrified she must had felt when they were caught and above all how desperate she had been to leave her dear kitty behind. How she had lived the next 6-7 months without writing. Her intellectual self-had the need to shed itself. How she had kept insanity without talking to Kitty, since that was one major thing which kept her going. 
 Anyhow, in the end, Kitty did do justice by bringing Anne Frank to the world. Otherwise we would have never known the intelligent girl like many others who must had been lost in evil-selfish human warmongering conquests."  # Generated from value "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency.

How many young teenagers are so eloquent, so self-conscious, so tenacious and so aware of the people that surround them? Anne, at a very young age, managed not only to understand but also to express many human truths--truths that range from mundane topics such as everyday life and relationships and politics to topics that even some critical-thinking adults can't seem to grasp, like life and death, peace and war, depression and happiness. 
 Anne Frank achieved a lot. She sent a message to the World, a message that, if only half the people listened to, would make this a better place. Oh--but she could have achieved so much more.

 UGH. This one was the worst... 
 I honestly don't know why this book is so highly rated. This one was definitely the worst of the three. It was a complete repeat of book one. I liked the beginning where she was starting to get little hints and glimpses that there was a rebellion starting in some of the districts. That part was exciting and I wanted to watch more of that unfold, but before I knew it we were back in the God damned arena. And then it was exactly like the first book, people dying all over the place, alliances being formed, and knowing all along that she's going to figure some way out of there for her and Peeta. She kept rambling on about sacrificing herself for Peeta and her martyrdom was SO.FUCKING.ANNOYING. We all knew she and Peeta weren't going to die. There was so much "action" in this one that I didn't even get a chance to care about anyone else in the arena with her. So as people were dying, even ones in her alliance, I did not find myself caring all that much. Maybe I had resigned myself to the belief that they might all die (except Katniss and Peeta) so I didn't allow myself to get attached to any of them. 
 So my advice would be to skip a whole bunch of chapters until they figure out how to blow up the arena and then pick it back up there. Then it gets more interesting again. But I felt left out of the uprising, left out of the "Catching Fire" that was the title of the book. We see little glimpses and then by the time they get rescued it's all out war. We don't get to see how the action in the arena has influenced the people of the districts and the rebellion. So I thought it was a lot of lazy writing. A lot of missed opportunities by going back into the arena. It could have been so much better if Katniss and Peeta had been mentors to the games, and we could have been involved in the rebellion alliance and then we could have been a part of the arena AND been better positioned to get information of the districts' uprising. She could have formed many of the same bonds with the other past tributes by way of her tribute forming alliances with theirs. But I guess it's no good to dwell on all the ways you could have written a better sequel. Anywho I don't have a lot else to say about this one."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it. This story that Collins has created, one about oppression and government control, rebellion and fighting for freedom, is so well done. There is never a dull moment. Everything that happens is happening for a reason, and the pacing is just perfect. 
 I know many people are upset that Katniss lost her "badassery-ness" from the first book, but really, this just made me connect with and understand her even more. What she went through in the first Games, and all the terrible stuff afterwards, is horrifying. Of course it's going to affect her. So many characters nowadays don't seem to feel anything - they just push away all the bad thoughts and keep fighting. They're kinda like Gale, in a way. Running on rage and not really taking in and dealing with all the bad. 
 Katniss isn't like that. What she went through, what she experienced, it affected her. It changed her. And that makes her character even more realistic. Friends were killed, she had to kill, she had to see the repercussions of her actions - these types of things affect you in ways you cannot imagine. She will never be just another girl from District 12. How could she be, after all she went through? 
 Collins has created a dynamic, complex cast of characters, and she is not afraid to kill them off. They are at war, after all. Death is to be expected. The only thing I'm not sure about is the last couple of chapters (not the epilogue). I like how everything resolved, just not sure in the way it resolved. But the more I think about it, the more I like it. Not a thing should be changed. 
 Also, I completely understand why Katniss did what she did, throughout the whole series. Any decisions she made, any actions she took, I understood her reasoning why, and almost always agreed with her. It's not easy to create a character in which readers truly understand, but Collins has done it here. She created a personality for Katniss that, while it did change based on what happened around her, the base of her character was always there. Splendid job in that regard. 
 Now, the epilogue. Maybe some people hate it, but honestly, I love it. It's so extremely powerful, and that last line? Yeah, that's a last sentence that I will always remember, word for word. It is the perfect way to end this series. Bravo, Suzanne Collins. Bravo. 
 *Even though I just finished re-reading the series, I could honestly start re-reading it all over again. That is how much I love this story. The Hunger Games is a series that I will definitely be re-reading over and over again in the future."  # Generated from value "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it. This story that Collins has created, one about oppression and government control, rebellion and fighting for freedom, is so well done. There is never a dull moment. Everything that happens is happening for a reason, and the pacing is just perfect. 
 I know many people are upset that Katniss lost her "badassery-ness" from the first book, but really, this just made me connect with and understand her even more. What she went through in the first Games, and all the terrible stuff afterwards, is horrifying. Of course it's going to affect her. So many characters nowadays don't seem to feel anything - they just push away all the bad thoughts and keep fighting. They're kinda like Gale, in a way. Running on rage and not really taking in and dealing with all the bad. 
 Katniss isn't like that. What she went through, what she experienced, it affected her. It changed her. And that makes her character even more realistic. Friends were killed, she had to kill, she had to see the repercussions of her actions - these types of things affect you in ways you cannot imagine. She will never be just another girl from District 12. How could she be, after all she went through? 
 Collins has created a dynamic, complex cast of characters, and she is not afraid to kill them off. They are at war, after all. Death is to be expected. The only thing I'm not sure about is the last couple of chapters (not the epilogue). I like how everything resolved, just not sure in the way it resolved. But the more I think about it, the more I like it. Not a thing should be changed.

 Well that escalated quickly! This one was my favorite of the series.... 
 Talk about a 180! The last book was boring and unimpressive, people were dying everywhere but I didn't give a fuck. This one, just the opposite. Almost all of my favorite characters die. It was sad, it was painful, it had emotion. Raw, real, guttural emotion. 
 I thought Suzanne Collins painted a pretty good picture of war. Particularly that there are no winners in war. We are introduced to district thirteen and immediately made uncomfortable by their militarized governing. There are so many rules here that it's almost worse than living in the districts. Though no one is left to die in the streets the way they were in district 12, there are very few real freedoms here. There's definitely subtle (or maybe not so subtle) stabs at both extreme conservative capitalism (in Panem there's no regulation and no gov't assistance, it's every man for himself) and extreme communism (in district 13 everyone eats exactly the number of calories they need, and everyone wears the same clothes and is provided identical living quarters). Suzanne Collins artfully shows how both extremes lead back to the same tyranny and oppression. We wanted so desperately to believe that district 13 was some kind of utopia of freedom, but in their attempt to be the exact opposite of the capitol and everything it stood for, they turned themselves into the capitol. 
 We are also introduced to another leader of the people, Coin. Katniss isn't sure what to make of her and neither are we. I wish she had delved a little more completely into the corruption of power, because by the time we meet Coin we are already a little leery of her and her motivations. As the book goes on we get to see more and more that Coin is not a friend to Katniss and by the end we don't believe that Coin is going to be any better than Snow as a leader of Panem. I cheered when Katniss took her down. 
 Katniss was suffering from a clear case of PTSD throughout this book, and considering all she went through up until this book (and then a shit-ton more during this book!) she deserved to be a little out of sorts. It made her even more real than the first two books could have. She was vulnerable and unsure and not the picture of the rebellion that district thirteen wanted her to be. In some ways I was disappointed that she didn't take over the capitol herself, but in others I am really glad that she didn't. I hated that her sister died, but it was the perfect catalyst to bring Katniss to question what she was a part of. If her sister hadn't died, she wouldn't have been lead down the path of discovering just who Coin was and what she was capable of doing. I like that Katniss was a complete mess after it all went down. Like I said before, there are no winners in war."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

 OMG. Everyone loves Katniss and she has no idea why. I have no idea either.... 
 Okay, right off the bat I have to admit that the love triangle drove me absolutely crazy. Peeta or Gale? Who the fuck cares? BUT I can say that I thought there was care in how Suzanne Collins explained the Katniss love. I would have really rolled my eyes if Peeta had said "there's just something different about her." I thought it was much better to tell that his dad was in love with her mom and pointed Katniss out to Peeta when he was young. Also the dad showed Katniss special favor when she sold him her game. Okay, this makes it a more believable situation where she would catch Peeta's attention. The fact that her and Gale formed a bond naturally around hunting is passable too. But the whole best friend turned lover thing is tired and boring, but forgivable I guess. 
 NOW THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY... I do like the dystopian setting of this book. The way that the capitol keeps control of the country and the citizens through zero tolerance patriotism, and the yearly punishment of forcing children to fight to the death in an arena while the games are broadcast to the entire nation. Considering the premise I didn't think the book was quite as dark as I had expected. I am not sure what I expected, but I can see why this is still acceptable among YA readers. 
 I did take a little bit of issue with the arena ending. I read all three books before writing these reviews so I can see why they made the arena ending the way they did. BUT I also think that because they made such a big deal about people being drawn to the love story between Katniss and Peeta, that to take away their promise of two survivors and to force one of them to kill the other at the end of the games might have been enough to spark a rebellion anyway. 
 I had a love/hate relationship with Katniss as a character. I think in this book I mostly liked her. Though I thought she was immature at times I had to remind myself that she was only supposed to be 16 or 17 years old. I thought many elements of her character were overplayed stereotypes. The strong young girl who pays no attention to boys, and is temperamental and harsh but still manages to have two boys in love with her at the same time. Old and tired. Why can't she be those things MINUS the attention from boys. We don't need to teach our daughters that they are validated because someone loves them despite their being bitchy and off-putting. And she was kinda bitchy and off-putting. I suppose that isn't much different from a typical teenage girl in a lot of ways, but maybe if we rewarded our characters for kindness over aloofness we may influence our teens to be kinder and less aloof. Maybe not. But I digress... there were elements of her that were admirable. Her undying love and protection of her sister and her bond with Rue in the arena showed that she did have a softer, kinder side that she reserved for only a few. She had some character flaws and vulnerabilities which made her more realistic and likeable. I was drawn into her story and wanted to read on to the rest of the series to find out what happens with her."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man". But I recently came across Junot Diaz's reading list for his writing class and noticed "The Hunger Games" there. It sparked curiosity and an assumption that if the plot was cheesy, at least this story would be a good model for writing. Indeed, it is an excellent model. The story is well-paced, compelling, and full of content. At first I thought that the themes of trust and friendship would undergird all the action and page-turning suspense. Yet I was pleased to see the critical commentary on modern society that Collin's hit on, especially the disgusting effects of reality TV, namely the sick level of exploitation in entertainment and the lack of empathy from those who control and profit from the system. Also, I liked how, through Katniss, the author lays bare our sense of audience-- that the characters have no privacy and their lives are constantly broadcasted for public consumption. I think this is very relevant, especially for young readers, with the dominance of online social media. Nor does Collin's miss the opportunity to make subtle yet clear comments on classism and inequality between the Districts. The only criticism I have is that I did not really like the voice of the narrator. Katniss is not particularly endearing, but sharp and practical. The character even describes herself as coming across as "heartless." Perhaps-- as the traditional gender roles have been reversed-- this is part of her survival adaptation, and winning the games proves her tact correct. Overall, I was impressed with the layers of meaning in this YA novel and it's entertainment value, despite its already being a huge commercial success."  # Generated from value "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man".

Instead of trying a bunch of books to see if I liked them I picked up The Hunger Games because I knew I loved the movies. I will admit that I loved the movies so much I was afraid to read this book because I feared that the book would ruin the movies as movies usually ruin books for me. If that makes sense?

 Also, haven seen the movie first, I loved how this book brought so much more to the story. The movie did a good job of being faithful to the story but the book adds so much more depth and detail that with both combined adds a fully amazing picture. 
 Highly recommend if you are a fan of the movie to read, or in my case listen, to the book as well. You won't be disappointed."  # Generated from value "Listened to this one on audio book.

 4.5 out of 5 stars 
 SPOILERS! But really I doubt you haven't read it yet! 
 So how can I review a book that's been read by everyone and made into movies love by everyone? LIKE THIS 
 This book takes place in a dystopian American society. The country now has a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer districts that only exist to produce goods for the capital. This novel centers around Katniss, a girl from the coal mining district 12. She's very poor and has to provide for her family in order for them to survive. Also In this society every year the Capitol has a competition called The Hunger Games. In these games, teenagers from all twelve districts are picked from a "reaping" and forced to fight to the death in these games. This is because before this society was created, the districts tried to rebel against the capitol and reach independence. When they failed, the Hunger games were created as punishment. This year, Katniss' younger sister is chosen. Rather than watch her sister be killed, she volunteers to go to the games in her place. 
 Now here's what I liked. Katniss. I LOVE Katniss. She's strong, she's practical, and she breaks down every single trope of YA heroines that you can think of. The book is in her POV. Part of the fun of the book is getting inside her head to see how she strategizes and how she reacts to the cruelty of the games. I also liked how district life felt almost historical, like it took place in the past. Then we get to the Capitol and it feels like science fiction. Then when we get to the actual games it feels like a survival story. The fact that all the sub-genres are seamlessly woven together is what makes this book so fun to read. It was fast paced and had wonderful side characters as well. 
 Now here are some things I, not disliked, but kind of expected more of because of all the hype. First, Rue's death was a little anti-climactic. I expected it to have more of an impact on Katniss than it did. Another thing was Peeta. I spent most of the book thinking that , like Katniss, he was faking the whole being in love thing. But him really being in love with her felt a little unnecessary. At least in this book. I felt it might've fit in later books. And there was one thing I really didn't understand. WTF WERE THE WOLF PEOPLE? Were they just designed to look like the dead tributes? Or were they the dead tributes made into wolf people? I don't understand. 
 So there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been already said. I really enjoyed the book, I had to read it for an English class. Still haven't seen the movie, will watch it today probably. And I hope everyone else has read it and enjoyed it as much as I did."  # Generated from value "The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins

         hasContent "** spoiler alert ** 
 I finished reading Twilight today. Took me about a day to read as it is such a quick read. I'm sure you've all read this. I put it off as long as possible. 
 I have a friend who had never read the Harry Potter series. She promised me she would read it if I read the Twilight series, so here I am. 
 I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Did I enjoy this? For a young reader, yes. I think it's more suited for high schoolers and younger. For adults? Meh. Here's my thoughts 
 It's a love story with a vampire. The beginning I thought was cute as it brought back the fun innocence of a crush (I've been married for a while now so this was fun to relive). Ex. The excitement of simply being in the same room or standing next to a person. I found that enduring. But once they had kissed, I saw red flags. Edward never let her make decisions. He always was telling her what was best for her, despite her protests... but she doesn't fight him too hard. You'd think after a while she'd get fed up. I would. Edward also couldn't keep his story straight. Ex. "I promise I'll be with you for forever. You'll never be alone. I love you." Then a few paragraphs later we get "It's not safe for you to be with me. We shouldn't be together." This happens continually throughout the book. His wishy-washy back and forth attitude was so reminiscent of high school dating. (Hence why I felt this was suited for a younger audience - you know this is the drama they crave). {I'm not denying I was like this. It's just obnoxious now} 
 Now Jacob. He wasn't in it too much. However, he actually asked and listened to what's Bella wanted. And he complimented her (Edward didn't always return compliments). And he made her relax. I also hated how he grew exponentially while she was away (she came back and he's 6'2"). I don't know of anyone who has a growth spurt that extreme. 
 I don't know which team I'm on yet as this first book doesn't really present you with an either-or conundrum. It was all about Bella and Edward. So I remain neutral. 
 Lastly, they left a loose end that bothered me. Bella calls her mom and leaves a voicemail frantically asking her to call before returning home. It turns out the bad guy intercepted it and responded. However, after he dies, mom shows up at the hospital to see Bella and never once mentions the voicemail. There's no way she wouldn't have called her moms cell phone. I know cell phones existed in this story because Bella used one to call her mom. And if she knew her mom wasn't home, why leave a message on a home message machine (plus - who even had those anymore?). So... mom should've clued in to the crazy that was going down in Phoenix. That bugged me. 
 Alright your Twilight fans. Do your worst. Tear me apart."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere. Girl meets boy. Boy barely manages to avoid eating girl. Boy and girl fall in love with each other. Boy stalks girl. Girl's okay with that. Boy probably won't kill girl, but he's making no promises. It's got a lot I like in a book passionate, chaste love-triangle-free romance (for the most part, if you stick to the first book); fantasy with a new perspective; excitement; a lot of pages. It's also repetitive, problematic, badly written. I was pretty surprised to see that I for the first time I couldn't enjoy it as much as before. Largely because for the first time, I read Edward as having no redeeming qualities. 
 Edward Cullen is cold. I'm not talking about his stone lips. I never realized before how mean and uncaring he is. Anytime Bella is uncomfortable or unhappy, he's laughing at her. Intellectually, I knew that the Edward/Bella relationship is abusive and controlling. But I didn't realize how much Edward uses that awful put-the-girl-down-to-make-her-like-you technique. Ugh. Edward Cullen is definitely not what Twilight has going for it. 
 Here's where Twilight's strengths are: The romantic/sexual tension in this book is largely very good. While I didn't find the meadow scene particularly compelling this go around, the build up to the first kiss is excellent. 
 The book really feels like two different books. The first chapter through the baseball scene, plus the epilogue feel like one book, while the prologue and baseball scene to the last chapter has a totally different tone. While somewhat suspenseful, the first portion is a meandering romance, while the latter portion feels like a somewhat dull thriller. 
 Overall, I wouldn't stop recommending this to fans of romance who can handle cheese. Although a handout identifying warning signs of abusive relationships nearby on the shelf wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm sure it's not my last reread, either. 
 Why people turn on Twilight: 
 -embarrassment because/ feeling of betrayal that they had liked Edward 
 -Breaking Dawn There are so many things embarrassingly much worse about that book compared to the rest of the series. It breaks all the rules of the world that have been set up previously. Everything about Renesmee from her name to existence is ridiculous. And things with Jacob get very squicky. 
 -because it inspires feverous praise, and then later people are embarrassed they praised it so much when they realize how flawed its writing/romance is 
 -because it's just plain kind of embarrassingly cheesy"  # Generated from value "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere.

         hasContent "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still. As hard as it may be to fathom this, I didn't know anything about the novel other than its Great Depression, Deep South setting. It is certainly eye opening today to hear the liberal use of racial epithets (the N word most notably) although it is certainly in keeping with the times and the location. 
 As much as I am fighting against it, I am a literary philistine when it comes to classic fiction. I spend most of my leisure reading time on non-fiction of all types so my reviews and ratings are often filtered through that lens. I very much enjoyed this novel, speaking as it does to the vile force that was and is racism in this country. Atticus Finch is certainly a worthy hero and I can see why this book is often taught in schools, despite the racism that is front and center. Atticus' attitude and belief system is admirable and his integrity shines through the whole narrative. His is certainly an attitude to life worth emulating. 
 The plot is not complex, taking place over three years but the racial themes, the loss of innocence, the lack of real justice and the humanity that runs through the narrator's father certainly make it pretty gripping reading. I am glad I read it and feel better informed, in my own small way, on a subject that is viscerally important to my liberal, bleeding heart!"  # Generated from value "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still.

 Angels & Demons... 
 This Dan Brown should be proud of himself...really. 
 This book and Da Vinci Code got me thinking...who the hell Dan Brown is. What is his academic background? I guess if the Illuminati ever came back to life and intended the wipe out Catholicism, they would drain their brains as they might but they wouldn't be able to come up with a plot as perfect and devilish as that of Dan Brown. This guy knows more than professors of history, physicists and religion men do; or at least he is a damn good researcher with an exceptional knowledge of rare fields like symbology and cryptography and a deep understanding of art, history and religions. It takes a smart professor of symbology to solve the riddles in the novel, but it takes a genius writer to create these riddles in the first place. Dan Brown is a genius. He really is. The air of mystery and apprehension in the novel is masterfully crafted that it engrossed me even when I off the book. I have to admit, I suspected all the characters. I suspected ALL of them except Langdon and Vittoria. I had to keep a computer close by so that every now and then I'd check google and youtube on scientific terms and historical facts. For me, this novel was not just a book; it was a whole experience. 
 Five stars...Yes. I fully enjoyed it... it is fairly long but you wouldn't wish it to end. My impression is mainly positive except for two points. The work as a whole deserves 5 stars nonetheless. 
 What I have to comment on rather than criticism is (spoilers coming ahead) 1) the Hassassin; the stereotypical sex-crazy terrorist barbaric Muslim Arab! Being a Muslim Arab, I felt offended. Plus... Come one Dan Brown, I guess you know better. The Hassassins, though considered a Shittii sect, were not at all religious. So I doubt that their descendants would in any way hold grudges against the church for sending the Crusaders centuries ago. And the few Arabic words the guy used - just to sound Arab - are of the Egyptian Dialect, while the Hassassins descendants, if any, would never be Egyptians. This might sound trivial (and this is why I didn't let this point affect my review) but the second point... I guess the director of the film version of the book would agree with me ... has to do with logic of events. Spinning over 128 chapters, the story was about a plot masterminded and carried out by a secret society; the Illuminati are many; they infiltrate organizations and hence, they are capable of carrying out an attack with the scale of that described in the novel; they can infiltrate the CERN, the Vatican; church, archives; monuments and all, the can infiltrate the Swiss Guard and the Vatican Police. This I understand. But reaching the end (folded in ONLY 9 chapters out of 137), it turned out that the whole plot was the work of a single guy! He is powerful; but he is one still. He imagined the full scenario and he had motives (a little bit overrated - but I think the author is implying that he was psychologically troubled). But when I tried to reconstruct the story from the new view point (that the camerlengo was the one behind the whole thing because he believed that the popessssss are not truly faithful to God), I had many questions that I couldn't find answers to; How did he recruit the Hassassin? Really? He did the whole thing in less then a month. How did he get that illuminati Muslim Arab Hassassin and convinced him to carry this out in revenge for his ancestors? In the film, the assassin did it for money, which was logical. But in the novel? It was all out of faith and loyalty. 2) How did he infiltrate the the CERN? Money? Maybe ..it just needed to be made clear. Guess to my humble mind, this is a very difficult fortress to break into. And finally, when the Hassassin called in the camerlengo's office, did he not recognize the guy's voice, since their relationship was only telephonic? Should I comment on Langdon's surviving a 3 mile fall from the helicopter? No, I won't. I still enjoyed the book greatly and still recommend it to everyone."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

This also, by the way, signals the first time a BOOK kicked my embarrassment squick into gear. Between Mrs. Bennet and Lydia, I just about crawled out of my skin a few times. On the other hand, there are some awesome lines and it felt like such a joyous relief when Darcy and Lizzie got on the same page and started being playful because, gawd, it's about time." located at cell 'reviews'!E38.,

The struggle to form an identity, and how the faction she rejections continued to define her...and how living in the space between factions was seen as dangerous resonated with my religious journey.

         hasContent "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read. My thoughts after reading this? I am still not sure... 
 Overall this book was an entertaining exciting read where if you ignore the fictional world and its gaps, it was pretty good for about 3/4 of it. At first I was concerned since the first 80 pages or so reminded me of a retelling of The Giver. I found too many similarities in the plot that bothered me but eventually I overlooked that and enjoyed the quick fun read. 
 I have to admit I found Tris really dumb at times and would roll my eyes at parts so I am not too attached to her as a main character. 
 Reading along, I was hoping that this would be one of the first dystopian novels I would love - but then like all the other novels similar to this - the plot gets weird and force-fed to the reader. We happily follow a solid plot then it twists to something messed up AND just as we learn characters, the author kills them off. 
 I am still confused on how I feel about this book as I really enjoyed majority of it BUT I hope this isnt a series that gets even more messed up that completely derails."  # Generated from value "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read.

The premise seemed a little manufactured. Perhaps it would be appropriate to call the author of this book "Dr. Frankenstein" as she seems to create a story from plots found in the dystopian futuristic graveyard.

         hasContent "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency. 
 The book is turned out to be so effective. Whether it's the sympathy driven success since a young girl who seems to be very refine writer got snatched the right to flourish naturally. Or it is real good write up. 
 I liked it because my rational mind accepts it rather than the emotional part would be swayed away by the ordeal of the girl. 
 At the age of 13 she is reading mythology and studying different languages. Reading was such a heavy part of her life, and not some ordinary reading (language, philosophy etc). The way she endured pain during hiding, thought critically and drew opinions based on her knowledge, reviewing books in a context that was related to her ordeal/life is something I held on to very dearly while reading. She had a clear idea what she wanted to do once they finish the hiding (spending time in Germany and London to get education on history of arts, languages). Some of the ideas like, 'the old people supposed to be less confused since they dealt with the hard part already and have pretty much worked out their ways than the younger evolving youth' and 'when you are upset, instead of holding on to the people who are miserable since their misery can make you realize the blessings in your life, one should rely on the happiness and colours around' are quite fascinating. She use to go back to the old entries in diary and see her complaining self which she found as "ungrateful". 
 The end makes me wonder how terrified she must had felt when they were caught and above all how desperate she had been to leave her dear kitty behind. How she had lived the next 6-7 months without writing. Her intellectual self-had the need to shed itself. How she had kept insanity without talking to Kitty, since that was one major thing which kept her going. 
 Anyhow, in the end, Kitty did do justice by bringing Anne Frank to the world. Otherwise we would have never known the intelligent girl like many others who must had been lost in evil-selfish human warmongering conquests."  # Generated from value "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency.

 UGH. This one was the worst... 
 I honestly don't know why this book is so highly rated. This one was definitely the worst of the three. It was a complete repeat of book one. I liked the beginning where she was starting to get little hints and glimpses that there was a rebellion starting in some of the districts. That part was exciting and I wanted to watch more of that unfold, but before I knew it we were back in the God damned arena. And then it was exactly like the first book, people dying all over the place, alliances being formed, and knowing all along that she's going to figure some way out of there for her and Peeta. She kept rambling on about sacrificing herself for Peeta and her martyrdom was SO.FUCKING.ANNOYING. We all knew she and Peeta weren't going to die. There was so much "action" in this one that I didn't even get a chance to care about anyone else in the arena with her. So as people were dying, even ones in her alliance, I did not find myself caring all that much. Maybe I had resigned myself to the belief that they might all die (except Katniss and Peeta) so I didn't allow myself to get attached to any of them. 
 So my advice would be to skip a whole bunch of chapters until they figure out how to blow up the arena and then pick it back up there. Then it gets more interesting again. But I felt left out of the uprising, left out of the "Catching Fire" that was the title of the book. We see little glimpses and then by the time they get rescued it's all out war. We don't get to see how the action in the arena has influenced the people of the districts and the rebellion. So I thought it was a lot of lazy writing. A lot of missed opportunities by going back into the arena. It could have been so much better if Katniss and Peeta had been mentors to the games, and we could have been involved in the rebellion alliance and then we could have been a part of the arena AND been better positioned to get information of the districts' uprising. She could have formed many of the same bonds with the other past tributes by way of her tribute forming alliances with theirs. But I guess it's no good to dwell on all the ways you could have written a better sequel. Anywho I don't have a lot else to say about this one."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

Perhaps so, because Katniss is so cool, with her proto-Artemis/Diana quiver and arrows, and her disdain for leg-shaving and desire to just live alone. I love too that defiance in the world of the hunger games is kindness and solidarity rather than blind self-interest and individualism. The whole series is a demented reversal of Gil Scot Heron's "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" in which the whole revolution is played out in hyperreality and simulacra, and not only the revolution, but the counter revolution will in fact be televised.

         hasContent "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it. This story that Collins has created, one about oppression and government control, rebellion and fighting for freedom, is so well done. There is never a dull moment. Everything that happens is happening for a reason, and the pacing is just perfect. 
 I know many people are upset that Katniss lost her "badassery-ness" from the first book, but really, this just made me connect with and understand her even more. What she went through in the first Games, and all the terrible stuff afterwards, is horrifying. Of course it's going to affect her. So many characters nowadays don't seem to feel anything - they just push away all the bad thoughts and keep fighting. They're kinda like Gale, in a way. Running on rage and not really taking in and dealing with all the bad. 
 Katniss isn't like that. What she went through, what she experienced, it affected her. It changed her. And that makes her character even more realistic. Friends were killed, she had to kill, she had to see the repercussions of her actions - these types of things affect you in ways you cannot imagine. She will never be just another girl from District 12. How could she be, after all she went through? 
 Collins has created a dynamic, complex cast of characters, and she is not afraid to kill them off. They are at war, after all. Death is to be expected. The only thing I'm not sure about is the last couple of chapters (not the epilogue). I like how everything resolved, just not sure in the way it resolved. But the more I think about it, the more I like it. Not a thing should be changed. 
 Also, I completely understand why Katniss did what she did, throughout the whole series. Any decisions she made, any actions she took, I understood her reasoning why, and almost always agreed with her. It's not easy to create a character in which readers truly understand, but Collins has done it here. She created a personality for Katniss that, while it did change based on what happened around her, the base of her character was always there. Splendid job in that regard. 
 Now, the epilogue. Maybe some people hate it, but honestly, I love it. It's so extremely powerful, and that last line? Yeah, that's a last sentence that I will always remember, word for word. It is the perfect way to end this series. Bravo, Suzanne Collins. Bravo.

 Well that escalated quickly! This one was my favorite of the series.... 
 Talk about a 180! The last book was boring and unimpressive, people were dying everywhere but I didn't give a fuck. This one, just the opposite. Almost all of my favorite characters die. It was sad, it was painful, it had emotion. Raw, real, guttural emotion. 
 I thought Suzanne Collins painted a pretty good picture of war. Particularly that there are no winners in war. We are introduced to district thirteen and immediately made uncomfortable by their militarized governing. There are so many rules here that it's almost worse than living in the districts. Though no one is left to die in the streets the way they were in district 12, there are very few real freedoms here. There's definitely subtle (or maybe not so subtle) stabs at both extreme conservative capitalism (in Panem there's no regulation and no gov't assistance, it's every man for himself) and extreme communism (in district 13 everyone eats exactly the number of calories they need, and everyone wears the same clothes and is provided identical living quarters). Suzanne Collins artfully shows how both extremes lead back to the same tyranny and oppression. We wanted so desperately to believe that district 13 was some kind of utopia of freedom, but in their attempt to be the exact opposite of the capitol and everything it stood for, they turned themselves into the capitol. 
 We are also introduced to another leader of the people, Coin. Katniss isn't sure what to make of her and neither are we. I wish she had delved a little more completely into the corruption of power, because by the time we meet Coin we are already a little leery of her and her motivations. As the book goes on we get to see more and more that Coin is not a friend to Katniss and by the end we don't believe that Coin is going to be any better than Snow as a leader of Panem. I cheered when Katniss took her down. 
 Katniss was suffering from a clear case of PTSD throughout this book, and considering all she went through up until this book (and then a shit-ton more during this book!) she deserved to be a little out of sorts. It made her even more real than the first two books could have. She was vulnerable and unsure and not the picture of the rebellion that district thirteen wanted her to be. In some ways I was disappointed that she didn't take over the capitol herself, but in others I am really glad that she didn't. I hated that her sister died, but it was the perfect catalyst to bring Katniss to question what she was a part of. If her sister hadn't died, she wouldn't have been lead down the path of discovering just who Coin was and what she was capable of doing. I like that Katniss was a complete mess after it all went down. Like I said before, there are no winners in war."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

 OMG. Everyone loves Katniss and she has no idea why. I have no idea either.... 
 Okay, right off the bat I have to admit that the love triangle drove me absolutely crazy. Peeta or Gale? Who the fuck cares? BUT I can say that I thought there was care in how Suzanne Collins explained the Katniss love. I would have really rolled my eyes if Peeta had said "there's just something different about her." I thought it was much better to tell that his dad was in love with her mom and pointed Katniss out to Peeta when he was young. Also the dad showed Katniss special favor when she sold him her game. Okay, this makes it a more believable situation where she would catch Peeta's attention. The fact that her and Gale formed a bond naturally around hunting is passable too. But the whole best friend turned lover thing is tired and boring, but forgivable I guess. 
 NOW THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY... I do like the dystopian setting of this book. The way that the capitol keeps control of the country and the citizens through zero tolerance patriotism, and the yearly punishment of forcing children to fight to the death in an arena while the games are broadcast to the entire nation. Considering the premise I didn't think the book was quite as dark as I had expected. I am not sure what I expected, but I can see why this is still acceptable among YA readers. 
 I did take a little bit of issue with the arena ending. I read all three books before writing these reviews so I can see why they made the arena ending the way they did. BUT I also think that because they made such a big deal about people being drawn to the love story between Katniss and Peeta, that to take away their promise of two survivors and to force one of them to kill the other at the end of the games might have been enough to spark a rebellion anyway. 
 I had a love/hate relationship with Katniss as a character. I think in this book I mostly liked her. Though I thought she was immature at times I had to remind myself that she was only supposed to be 16 or 17 years old. I thought many elements of her character were overplayed stereotypes. The strong young girl who pays no attention to boys, and is temperamental and harsh but still manages to have two boys in love with her at the same time. Old and tired. Why can't she be those things MINUS the attention from boys. We don't need to teach our daughters that they are validated because someone loves them despite their being bitchy and off-putting. And she was kinda bitchy and off-putting. I suppose that isn't much different from a typical teenage girl in a lot of ways, but maybe if we rewarded our characters for kindness over aloofness we may influence our teens to be kinder and less aloof. Maybe not. But I digress... there were elements of her that were admirable. Her undying love and protection of her sister and her bond with Rue in the arena showed that she did have a softer, kinder side that she reserved for only a few. She had some character flaws and vulnerabilities which made her more realistic and likeable. I was drawn into her story and wanted to read on to the rest of the series to find out what happens with her."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man". But I recently came across Junot Diaz's reading list for his writing class and noticed "The Hunger Games" there. It sparked curiosity and an assumption that if the plot was cheesy, at least this story would be a good model for writing. Indeed, it is an excellent model. The story is well-paced, compelling, and full of content. At first I thought that the themes of trust and friendship would undergird all the action and page-turning suspense. Yet I was pleased to see the critical commentary on modern society that Collin's hit on, especially the disgusting effects of reality TV, namely the sick level of exploitation in entertainment and the lack of empathy from those who control and profit from the system. Also, I liked how, through Katniss, the author lays bare our sense of audience-- that the characters have no privacy and their lives are constantly broadcasted for public consumption. I think this is very relevant, especially for young readers, with the dominance of online social media. Nor does Collin's miss the opportunity to make subtle yet clear comments on classism and inequality between the Districts. The only criticism I have is that I did not really like the voice of the narrator. Katniss is not particularly endearing, but sharp and practical. The character even describes herself as coming across as "heartless." Perhaps-- as the traditional gender roles have been reversed-- this is part of her survival adaptation, and winning the games proves her tact correct. Overall, I was impressed with the layers of meaning in this YA novel and it's entertainment value, despite its already being a huge commercial success."  # Generated from value "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man".

 4.5 out of 5 stars 
 SPOILERS! But really I doubt you haven't read it yet! 
 So how can I review a book that's been read by everyone and made into movies love by everyone? LIKE THIS 
 This book takes place in a dystopian American society. The country now has a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer districts that only exist to produce goods for the capital. This novel centers around Katniss, a girl from the coal mining district 12. She's very poor and has to provide for her family in order for them to survive. Also In this society every year the Capitol has a competition called The Hunger Games. In these games, teenagers from all twelve districts are picked from a "reaping" and forced to fight to the death in these games. This is because before this society was created, the districts tried to rebel against the capitol and reach independence. When they failed, the Hunger games were created as punishment. This year, Katniss' younger sister is chosen. Rather than watch her sister be killed, she volunteers to go to the games in her place. 
 Now here's what I liked. Katniss. I LOVE Katniss. She's strong, she's practical, and she breaks down every single trope of YA heroines that you can think of. The book is in her POV. Part of the fun of the book is getting inside her head to see how she strategizes and how she reacts to the cruelty of the games. I also liked how district life felt almost historical, like it took place in the past. Then we get to the Capitol and it feels like science fiction. Then when we get to the actual games it feels like a survival story. The fact that all the sub-genres are seamlessly woven together is what makes this book so fun to read. It was fast paced and had wonderful side characters as well. 
 Now here are some things I, not disliked, but kind of expected more of because of all the hype. First, Rue's death was a little anti-climactic. I expected it to have more of an impact on Katniss than it did. Another thing was Peeta. I spent most of the book thinking that , like Katniss, he was faking the whole being in love thing. But him really being in love with her felt a little unnecessary. At least in this book. I felt it might've fit in later books. And there was one thing I really didn't understand. WTF WERE THE WOLF PEOPLE? Were they just designed to look like the dead tributes? Or were they the dead tributes made into wolf people? I don't understand. 
 So there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been already said. I really enjoyed the book, I had to read it for an English class. Still haven't seen the movie, will watch it today probably. And I hope everyone else has read it and enjoyed it as much as I did."  # Generated from value "The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins

         hasContent "** spoiler alert ** 
 I finished reading Twilight today. Took me about a day to read as it is such a quick read. I'm sure you've all read this. I put it off as long as possible. 
 I have a friend who had never read the Harry Potter series. She promised me she would read it if I read the Twilight series, so here I am. 
 I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Did I enjoy this? For a young reader, yes. I think it's more suited for high schoolers and younger. For adults? Meh. Here's my thoughts 
 It's a love story with a vampire. The beginning I thought was cute as it brought back the fun innocence of a crush (I've been married for a while now so this was fun to relive). Ex. The excitement of simply being in the same room or standing next to a person. I found that enduring. But once they had kissed, I saw red flags. Edward never let her make decisions. He always was telling her what was best for her, despite her protests... but she doesn't fight him too hard. You'd think after a while she'd get fed up. I would. Edward also couldn't keep his story straight. Ex. "I promise I'll be with you for forever. You'll never be alone. I love you." Then a few paragraphs later we get "It's not safe for you to be with me. We shouldn't be together." This happens continually throughout the book. His wishy-washy back and forth attitude was so reminiscent of high school dating. (Hence why I felt this was suited for a younger audience - you know this is the drama they crave). {I'm not denying I was like this. It's just obnoxious now} 
 Now Jacob. He wasn't in it too much. However, he actually asked and listened to what's Bella wanted. And he complimented her (Edward didn't always return compliments). And he made her relax. I also hated how he grew exponentially while she was away (she came back and he's 6'2"). I don't know of anyone who has a growth spurt that extreme. 
 I don't know which team I'm on yet as this first book doesn't really present you with an either-or conundrum. It was all about Bella and Edward. So I remain neutral. 
 Lastly, they left a loose end that bothered me. Bella calls her mom and leaves a voicemail frantically asking her to call before returning home. It turns out the bad guy intercepted it and responded. However, after he dies, mom shows up at the hospital to see Bella and never once mentions the voicemail. There's no way she wouldn't have called her moms cell phone. I know cell phones existed in this story because Bella used one to call her mom. And if she knew her mom wasn't home, why leave a message on a home message machine (plus - who even had those anymore?). So... mom should've clued in to the crazy that was going down in Phoenix. That bugged me. 
 Alright your Twilight fans. Do your worst. Tear me apart."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert ** 
 I finished reading Twilight today. Took me about a day to read as it is such a quick read. I'm sure you've all read this. I put it off as long as possible. 
 I have a friend who had never read the Harry Potter series. She promised me she would read it if I read the Twilight series, so here I am. 
 I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Did I enjoy this? For a young reader, yes. I think it's more suited for high schoolers and younger. For adults? Meh. Here's my thoughts 
 It's a love story with a vampire. The beginning I thought was cute as it brought back the fun innocence of a crush (I've been married for a while now so this was fun to relive). Ex. The excitement of simply being in the same room or standing next to a person. I found that enduring. But once they had kissed, I saw red flags. Edward never let her make decisions. He always was telling her what was best for her, despite her protests... but she doesn't fight him too hard. You'd think after a while she'd get fed up. I would. Edward also couldn't keep his story straight. Ex. "I promise I'll be with you for forever. You'll never be alone. I love you." Then a few paragraphs later we get "It's not safe for you to be with me. We shouldn't be together." This happens continually throughout the book. His wishy-washy back and forth attitude was so reminiscent of high school dating. (Hence why I felt this was suited for a younger audience - you know this is the drama they crave). {I'm not denying I was like this. It's just obnoxious now} 
 Now Jacob. He wasn't in it too much. However, he actually asked and listened to what's Bella wanted. And he complimented her (Edward didn't always return compliments). And he made her relax. I also hated how he grew exponentially while she was away (she came back and he's 6'2"). I don't know of anyone who has a growth spurt that extreme. 
 I don't know which team I'm on yet as this first book doesn't really present you with an either-or conundrum. It was all about Bella and Edward. So I remain neutral. 
 Lastly, they left a loose end that bothered me. Bella calls her mom and leaves a voicemail frantically asking her to call before returning home.

         hasContent "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere. Girl meets boy. Boy barely manages to avoid eating girl. Boy and girl fall in love with each other. Boy stalks girl. Girl's okay with that. Boy probably won't kill girl, but he's making no promises. It's got a lot I like in a book passionate, chaste love-triangle-free romance (for the most part, if you stick to the first book); fantasy with a new perspective; excitement; a lot of pages. It's also repetitive, problematic, badly written. I was pretty surprised to see that I for the first time I couldn't enjoy it as much as before. Largely because for the first time, I read Edward as having no redeeming qualities. 
 Edward Cullen is cold. I'm not talking about his stone lips. I never realized before how mean and uncaring he is. Anytime Bella is uncomfortable or unhappy, he's laughing at her. Intellectually, I knew that the Edward/Bella relationship is abusive and controlling. But I didn't realize how much Edward uses that awful put-the-girl-down-to-make-her-like-you technique. Ugh. Edward Cullen is definitely not what Twilight has going for it. 
 Here's where Twilight's strengths are: The romantic/sexual tension in this book is largely very good. While I didn't find the meadow scene particularly compelling this go around, the build up to the first kiss is excellent. 
 The book really feels like two different books. The first chapter through the baseball scene, plus the epilogue feel like one book, while the prologue and baseball scene to the last chapter has a totally different tone. While somewhat suspenseful, the first portion is a meandering romance, while the latter portion feels like a somewhat dull thriller. 
 Overall, I wouldn't stop recommending this to fans of romance who can handle cheese. Although a handout identifying warning signs of abusive relationships nearby on the shelf wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm sure it's not my last reread, either. 
 Why people turn on Twilight: 
 -embarrassment because/ feeling of betrayal that they had liked Edward 
 -Breaking Dawn There are so many things embarrassingly much worse about that book compared to the rest of the series. It breaks all the rules of the world that have been set up previously. Everything about Renesmee from her name to existence is ridiculous. And things with Jacob get very squicky. 
 -because it inspires feverous praise, and then later people are embarrassed they praised it so much when they realize how flawed its writing/romance is 
 -because it's just plain kind of embarrassingly cheesy"  # Generated from value "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere.

As hard as it may be to fathom this, I didn't know anything about the novel other than its Great Depression, Deep South setting. It is certainly eye opening today to hear the liberal use of racial epithets (the N word most notably) although it is certainly in keeping with the times and the location. 
 As much as I am fighting against it, I am a literary philistine when it comes to classic fiction. I spend most of my leisure reading time on non-fiction of all types so my reviews and ratings are often filtered through that lens. I very much enjoyed this novel, speaking as it does to the vile force that was and is racism in this country. Atticus Finch is certainly a worthy hero and I can see why this book is often taught in schools, despite the racism that is front and center. Atticus' attitude and belief system is admirable and his integrity shines through the whole narrative. His is certainly an attitude to life worth emulating. 
 The plot is not complex, taking place over three years but the racial themes, the loss of innocence, the lack of real justice and the humanity that runs through the narrator's father certainly make it pretty gripping reading. I am glad I read it and feel better informed, in my own small way, on a subject that is viscerally important to my liberal, bleeding heart!"  # Generated from value "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still.

 Angels & Demons... 
 This Dan Brown should be proud of himself...really. 
 This book and Da Vinci Code got me thinking...who the hell Dan Brown is. What is his academic background? I guess if the Illuminati ever came back to life and intended the wipe out Catholicism, they would drain their brains as they might but they wouldn't be able to come up with a plot as perfect and devilish as that of Dan Brown. This guy knows more than professors of history, physicists and religion men do; or at least he is a damn good researcher with an exceptional knowledge of rare fields like symbology and cryptography and a deep understanding of art, history and religions. It takes a smart professor of symbology to solve the riddles in the novel, but it takes a genius writer to create these riddles in the first place. Dan Brown is a genius. He really is. The air of mystery and apprehension in the novel is masterfully crafted that it engrossed me even when I off the book. I have to admit, I suspected all the characters. I suspected ALL of them except Langdon and Vittoria. I had to keep a computer close by so that every now and then I'd check google and youtube on scientific terms and historical facts. For me, this novel was not just a book; it was a whole experience. 
 Five stars...Yes. I fully enjoyed it... it is fairly long but you wouldn't wish it to end. My impression is mainly positive except for two points. The work as a whole deserves 5 stars nonetheless. 
 What I have to comment on rather than criticism is (spoilers coming ahead) 1) the Hassassin; the stereotypical sex-crazy terrorist barbaric Muslim Arab! Being a Muslim Arab, I felt offended. Plus... Come one Dan Brown, I guess you know better. The Hassassins, though considered a Shittii sect, were not at all religious. So I doubt that their descendants would in any way hold grudges against the church for sending the Crusaders centuries ago. And the few Arabic words the guy used - just to sound Arab - are of the Egyptian Dialect, while the Hassassins descendants, if any, would never be Egyptians. This might sound trivial (and this is why I didn't let this point affect my review) but the second point... I guess the director of the film version of the book would agree with me ... has to do with logic of events. Spinning over 128 chapters, the story was about a plot masterminded and carried out by a secret society; the Illuminati are many; they infiltrate organizations and hence, they are capable of carrying out an attack with the scale of that described in the novel; they can infiltrate the CERN, the Vatican; church, archives; monuments and all, the can infiltrate the Swiss Guard and the Vatican Police. This I understand. But reaching the end (folded in ONLY 9 chapters out of 137), it turned out that the whole plot was the work of a single guy! He is powerful; but he is one still. He imagined the full scenario and he had motives (a little bit overrated - but I think the author is implying that he was psychologically troubled). But when I tried to reconstruct the story from the new view point (that the camerlengo was the one behind the whole thing because he believed that the popessssss are not truly faithful to God), I had many questions that I couldn't find answers to; How did he recruit the Hassassin? Really? He did the whole thing in less then a month. How did he get that illuminati Muslim Arab Hassassin and convinced him to carry this out in revenge for his ancestors? In the film, the assassin did it for money, which was logical. But in the novel? It was all out of faith and loyalty. 2) How did he infiltrate the the CERN? Money? Maybe ..it just needed to be made clear. Guess to my humble mind, this is a very difficult fortress to break into. And finally, when the Hassassin called in the camerlengo's office, did he not recognize the guy's voice, since their relationship was only telephonic? Should I comment on Langdon's surviving a 3 mile fall from the helicopter? No, I won't. I still enjoyed the book greatly and still recommend it to everyone."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

So far 2017 has been a disappointing 8 months until now. I am so in love with EVERYTHING about this book (and am so happy I finally got round to it; it has been on my reading list for years). 
 I am currently making my way through "The Complete Novels of Jane Austen" (all 1278 pages of it) and Pride and Prejudice is book 2 of 7. Sense and Sensibility was first and although I appreciated Austen's humour and writing, I was not a fan of this novel. 
 So imagine my sheer delight when I loved P&P from page 1. There is laugh-out-loud humour, scandal, insufferable characters, loveable characters, and of course romance. I loved the way Austen developed the characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet who I see to be intelligent and smart, full of integrity, and quite the feminist. 
 Next up is book 3/7 Mansfield Park."  # Generated from value "It has been so long since I have read a book that I couldn't put down.

         hasContent "Pride and Prejudice is the formula for the modern chick-flick. A man and a woman who have no chance of being together, and for most of the story do not even like each other, find themselves drawn in more and more by each other and in the end live happily ever after. It is an overused premise nowadays, but I do have to give credit to Jane Austen seeing as she wrote it in 1813 and its basic plot structure has been copied a million different times, just proves her genius. I thought it also cleverly makes fun of the ridiculous social constructs of the time and the manner in which people are expected to address one another. This last point can get lost in the old English writing"  # Generated from value "Pride and Prejudice is the formula for the modern chick-flick.

This also, by the way, signals the first time a BOOK kicked my embarrassment squick into gear. Between Mrs. Bennet and Lydia, I just about crawled out of my skin a few times.

 Overall this book was an entertaining exciting read where if you ignore the fictional world and its gaps, it was pretty good for about 3/4 of it. At first I was concerned since the first 80 pages or so reminded me of a retelling of The Giver. I found too many similarities in the plot that bothered me but eventually I overlooked that and enjoyed the quick fun read. 
 I have to admit I found Tris really dumb at times and would roll my eyes at parts so I am not too attached to her as a main character. 
 Reading along, I was hoping that this would be one of the first dystopian novels I would love - but then like all the other novels similar to this - the plot gets weird and force-fed to the reader. We happily follow a solid plot then it twists to something messed up AND just as we learn characters, the author kills them off. 
 I am still confused on how I feel about this book as I really enjoyed majority of it BUT I hope this isnt a series that gets even more messed up that completely derails."  # Generated from value "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read.

         hasContent "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency. 
 The book is turned out to be so effective. Whether it's the sympathy driven success since a young girl who seems to be very refine writer got snatched the right to flourish naturally. Or it is real good write up. 
 I liked it because my rational mind accepts it rather than the emotional part would be swayed away by the ordeal of the girl. 
 At the age of 13 she is reading mythology and studying different languages. Reading was such a heavy part of her life, and not some ordinary reading (language, philosophy etc). The way she endured pain during hiding, thought critically and drew opinions based on her knowledge, reviewing books in a context that was related to her ordeal/life is something I held on to very dearly while reading. She had a clear idea what she wanted to do once they finish the hiding (spending time in Germany and London to get education on history of arts, languages). Some of the ideas like, 'the old people supposed to be less confused since they dealt with the hard part already and have pretty much worked out their ways than the younger evolving youth' and 'when you are upset, instead of holding on to the people who are miserable since their misery can make you realize the blessings in your life, one should rely on the happiness and colours around' are quite fascinating. She use to go back to the old entries in diary and see her complaining self which she found as "ungrateful". 
 The end makes me wonder how terrified she must had felt when they were caught and above all how desperate she had been to leave her dear kitty behind. How she had lived the next 6-7 months without writing. Her intellectual self-had the need to shed itself. How she had kept insanity without talking to Kitty, since that was one major thing which kept her going. 
 Anyhow, in the end, Kitty did do justice by bringing Anne Frank to the world. Otherwise we would have never known the intelligent girl like many others who must had been lost in evil-selfish human warmongering conquests."  # Generated from value "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency.

How many young teenagers are so eloquent, so self-conscious, so tenacious and so aware of the people that surround them? Anne, at a very young age, managed not only to understand but also to express many human truths--truths that range from mundane topics such as everyday life and relationships and politics to topics that even some critical-thinking adults can't seem to grasp, like life and death, peace and war, depression and happiness. 
 Anne Frank achieved a lot. She sent a message to the World, a message that, if only half the people listened to, would make this a better place. Oh--but she could have achieved so much more. Her story makes me feel both distressed and optimistic. I would recommend this book to anyone."  # Generated from value "It's difficult to explain at what level this book touched me.

 UGH. This one was the worst... 
 I honestly don't know why this book is so highly rated. This one was definitely the worst of the three. It was a complete repeat of book one. I liked the beginning where she was starting to get little hints and glimpses that there was a rebellion starting in some of the districts. That part was exciting and I wanted to watch more of that unfold, but before I knew it we were back in the God damned arena. And then it was exactly like the first book, people dying all over the place, alliances being formed, and knowing all along that she's going to figure some way out of there for her and Peeta. She kept rambling on about sacrificing herself for Peeta and her martyrdom was SO.FUCKING.ANNOYING. We all knew she and Peeta weren't going to die. There was so much "action" in this one that I didn't even get a chance to care about anyone else in the arena with her. So as people were dying, even ones in her alliance, I did not find myself caring all that much. Maybe I had resigned myself to the belief that they might all die (except Katniss and Peeta) so I didn't allow myself to get attached to any of them. 
 So my advice would be to skip a whole bunch of chapters until they figure out how to blow up the arena and then pick it back up there. Then it gets more interesting again. But I felt left out of the uprising, left out of the "Catching Fire" that was the title of the book. We see little glimpses and then by the time they get rescued it's all out war. We don't get to see how the action in the arena has influenced the people of the districts and the rebellion. So I thought it was a lot of lazy writing. A lot of missed opportunities by going back into the arena. It could have been so much better if Katniss and Peeta had been mentors to the games, and we could have been involved in the rebellion alliance and then we could have been a part of the arena AND been better positioned to get information of the districts' uprising. She could have formed many of the same bonds with the other past tributes by way of her tribute forming alliances with theirs. But I guess it's no good to dwell on all the ways you could have written a better sequel. Anywho I don't have a lot else to say about this one."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

Perhaps so, because Katniss is so cool, with her proto-Artemis/Diana quiver and arrows, and her disdain for leg-shaving and desire to just live alone. I love too that defiance in the world of the hunger games is kindness and solidarity rather than blind self-interest and individualism. The whole series is a demented reversal of Gil Scot Heron's "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" in which the whole revolution is played out in hyperreality and simulacra, and not only the revolution, but the counter revolution will in fact be televised.

         hasContent "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it. This story that Collins has created, one about oppression and government control, rebellion and fighting for freedom, is so well done. There is never a dull moment. Everything that happens is happening for a reason, and the pacing is just perfect. 
 I know many people are upset that Katniss lost her "badassery-ness" from the first book, but really, this just made me connect with and understand her even more. What she went through in the first Games, and all the terrible stuff afterwards, is horrifying. Of course it's going to affect her. So many characters nowadays don't seem to feel anything - they just push away all the bad thoughts and keep fighting. They're kinda like Gale, in a way. Running on rage and not really taking in and dealing with all the bad. 
 Katniss isn't like that. What she went through, what she experienced, it affected her. It changed her. And that makes her character even more realistic. Friends were killed, she had to kill, she had to see the repercussions of her actions - these types of things affect you in ways you cannot imagine. She will never be just another girl from District 12. How could she be, after all she went through? 
 Collins has created a dynamic, complex cast of characters, and she is not afraid to kill them off. They are at war, after all. Death is to be expected. The only thing I'm not sure about is the last couple of chapters (not the epilogue). I like how everything resolved, just not sure in the way it resolved. But the more I think about it, the more I like it. Not a thing should be changed. 
 Also, I completely understand why Katniss did what she did, throughout the whole series. Any decisions she made, any actions she took, I understood her reasoning why, and almost always agreed with her. It's not easy to create a character in which readers truly understand, but Collins has done it here. She created a personality for Katniss that, while it did change based on what happened around her, the base of her character was always there. Splendid job in that regard. 
 Now, the epilogue. Maybe some people hate it, but honestly, I love it. It's so extremely powerful, and that last line? Yeah, that's a last sentence that I will always remember, word for word. It is the perfect way to end this series. Bravo, Suzanne Collins. Bravo. 
 *Even though I just finished re-reading the series, I could honestly start re-reading it all over again. That is how much I love this story. The Hunger Games is a series that I will definitely be re-reading over and over again in the future."  # Generated from value "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it.

 Well that escalated quickly! This one was my favorite of the series.... 
 Talk about a 180! The last book was boring and unimpressive, people were dying everywhere but I didn't give a fuck. This one, just the opposite. Almost all of my favorite characters die. It was sad, it was painful, it had emotion. Raw, real, guttural emotion. 
 I thought Suzanne Collins painted a pretty good picture of war. Particularly that there are no winners in war. We are introduced to district thirteen and immediately made uncomfortable by their militarized governing. There are so many rules here that it's almost worse than living in the districts. Though no one is left to die in the streets the way they were in district 12, there are very few real freedoms here. There's definitely subtle (or maybe not so subtle) stabs at both extreme conservative capitalism (in Panem there's no regulation and no gov't assistance, it's every man for himself) and extreme communism (in district 13 everyone eats exactly the number of calories they need, and everyone wears the same clothes and is provided identical living quarters). Suzanne Collins artfully shows how both extremes lead back to the same tyranny and oppression. We wanted so desperately to believe that district 13 was some kind of utopia of freedom, but in their attempt to be the exact opposite of the capitol and everything it stood for, they turned themselves into the capitol. 
 We are also introduced to another leader of the people, Coin. Katniss isn't sure what to make of her and neither are we. I wish she had delved a little more completely into the corruption of power, because by the time we meet Coin we are already a little leery of her and her motivations. As the book goes on we get to see more and more that Coin is not a friend to Katniss and by the end we don't believe that Coin is going to be any better than Snow as a leader of Panem. I cheered when Katniss took her down. 
 Katniss was suffering from a clear case of PTSD throughout this book, and considering all she went through up until this book (and then a shit-ton more during this book!) she deserved to be a little out of sorts. It made her even more real than the first two books could have. She was vulnerable and unsure and not the picture of the rebellion that district thirteen wanted her to be. In some ways I was disappointed that she didn't take over the capitol herself, but in others I am really glad that she didn't. I hated that her sister died, but it was the perfect catalyst to bring Katniss to question what she was a part of. If her sister hadn't died, she wouldn't have been lead down the path of discovering just who Coin was and what she was capable of doing. I like that Katniss was a complete mess after it all went down. Like I said before, there are no winners in war."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

 OMG. Everyone loves Katniss and she has no idea why. I have no idea either.... 
 Okay, right off the bat I have to admit that the love triangle drove me absolutely crazy. Peeta or Gale? Who the fuck cares? BUT I can say that I thought there was care in how Suzanne Collins explained the Katniss love. I would have really rolled my eyes if Peeta had said "there's just something different about her." I thought it was much better to tell that his dad was in love with her mom and pointed Katniss out to Peeta when he was young. Also the dad showed Katniss special favor when she sold him her game. Okay, this makes it a more believable situation where she would catch Peeta's attention. The fact that her and Gale formed a bond naturally around hunting is passable too. But the whole best friend turned lover thing is tired and boring, but forgivable I guess. 
 NOW THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY... I do like the dystopian setting of this book. The way that the capitol keeps control of the country and the citizens through zero tolerance patriotism, and the yearly punishment of forcing children to fight to the death in an arena while the games are broadcast to the entire nation. Considering the premise I didn't think the book was quite as dark as I had expected. I am not sure what I expected, but I can see why this is still acceptable among YA readers. 
 I did take a little bit of issue with the arena ending. I read all three books before writing these reviews so I can see why they made the arena ending the way they did. BUT I also think that because they made such a big deal about people being drawn to the love story between Katniss and Peeta, that to take away their promise of two survivors and to force one of them to kill the other at the end of the games might have been enough to spark a rebellion anyway. 
 I had a love/hate relationship with Katniss as a character. I think in this book I mostly liked her. Though I thought she was immature at times I had to remind myself that she was only supposed to be 16 or 17 years old. I thought many elements of her character were overplayed stereotypes. The strong young girl who pays no attention to boys, and is temperamental and harsh but still manages to have two boys in love with her at the same time. Old and tired. Why can't she be those things MINUS the attention from boys. We don't need to teach our daughters that they are validated because someone loves them despite their being bitchy and off-putting. And she was kinda bitchy and off-putting. I suppose that isn't much different from a typical teenage girl in a lot of ways, but maybe if we rewarded our characters for kindness over aloofness we may influence our teens to be kinder and less aloof. Maybe not. But I digress... there were elements of her that were admirable. Her undying love and protection of her sister and her bond with Rue in the arena showed that she did have a softer, kinder side that she reserved for only a few. She had some character flaws and vulnerabilities which made her more realistic and likeable. I was drawn into her story and wanted to read on to the rest of the series to find out what happens with her."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert ** 
 OMG. Everyone loves Katniss and she has no idea why. I have no idea either.... 
 Okay, right off the bat I have to admit that the love triangle drove me absolutely crazy. Peeta or Gale? Who the fuck cares? BUT I can say that I thought there was care in how Suzanne Collins explained the Katniss love. I would have really rolled my eyes if Peeta had said "there's just something different about her." I thought it was much better to tell that his dad was in love with her mom and pointed Katniss out to Peeta when he was young. Also the dad showed Katniss special favor when she sold him her game. Okay, this makes it a more believable situation where she would catch Peeta's attention. The fact that her and Gale formed a bond naturally around hunting is passable too. But the whole best friend turned lover thing is tired and boring, but forgivable I guess. 
 NOW THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY... I do like the dystopian setting of this book. The way that the capitol keeps control of the country and the citizens through zero tolerance patriotism, and the yearly punishment of forcing children to fight to the death in an arena while the games are broadcast to the entire nation. Considering the premise I didn't think the book was quite as dark as I had expected. I am not sure what I expected, but I can see why this is still acceptable among YA readers.

         hasContent "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man". But I recently came across Junot Diaz's reading list for his writing class and noticed "The Hunger Games" there. It sparked curiosity and an assumption that if the plot was cheesy, at least this story would be a good model for writing. Indeed, it is an excellent model. The story is well-paced, compelling, and full of content. At first I thought that the themes of trust and friendship would undergird all the action and page-turning suspense. Yet I was pleased to see the critical commentary on modern society that Collin's hit on, especially the disgusting effects of reality TV, namely the sick level of exploitation in entertainment and the lack of empathy from those who control and profit from the system. Also, I liked how, through Katniss, the author lays bare our sense of audience-- that the characters have no privacy and their lives are constantly broadcasted for public consumption. I think this is very relevant, especially for young readers, with the dominance of online social media. Nor does Collin's miss the opportunity to make subtle yet clear comments on classism and inequality between the Districts. The only criticism I have is that I did not really like the voice of the narrator. Katniss is not particularly endearing, but sharp and practical. The character even describes herself as coming across as "heartless." Perhaps-- as the traditional gender roles have been reversed-- this is part of her survival adaptation, and winning the games proves her tact correct. Overall, I was impressed with the layers of meaning in this YA novel and it's entertainment value, despite its already being a huge commercial success."  # Generated from value "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man".

 4.5 out of 5 stars 
 SPOILERS! But really I doubt you haven't read it yet! 
 So how can I review a book that's been read by everyone and made into movies love by everyone? LIKE THIS 
 This book takes place in a dystopian American society. The country now has a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer districts that only exist to produce goods for the capital. This novel centers around Katniss, a girl from the coal mining district 12. She's very poor and has to provide for her family in order for them to survive. Also In this society every year the Capitol has a competition called The Hunger Games. In these games, teenagers from all twelve districts are picked from a "reaping" and forced to fight to the death in these games. This is because before this society was created, the districts tried to rebel against the capitol and reach independence. When they failed, the Hunger games were created as punishment. This year, Katniss' younger sister is chosen. Rather than watch her sister be killed, she volunteers to go to the games in her place. 
 Now here's what I liked. Katniss. I LOVE Katniss. She's strong, she's practical, and she breaks down every single trope of YA heroines that you can think of. The book is in her POV. Part of the fun of the book is getting inside her head to see how she strategizes and how she reacts to the cruelty of the games. I also liked how district life felt almost historical, like it took place in the past. Then we get to the Capitol and it feels like science fiction. Then when we get to the actual games it feels like a survival story. The fact that all the sub-genres are seamlessly woven together is what makes this book so fun to read. It was fast paced and had wonderful side characters as well. 
 Now here are some things I, not disliked, but kind of expected more of because of all the hype. First, Rue's death was a little anti-climactic. I expected it to have more of an impact on Katniss than it did. Another thing was Peeta. I spent most of the book thinking that , like Katniss, he was faking the whole being in love thing. But him really being in love with her felt a little unnecessary. At least in this book. I felt it might've fit in later books. And there was one thing I really didn't understand. WTF WERE THE WOLF PEOPLE? Were they just designed to look like the dead tributes? Or were they the dead tributes made into wolf people? I don't understand. 
 So there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been already said. I really enjoyed the book, I had to read it for an English class. Still haven't seen the movie, will watch it today probably. And I hope everyone else has read it and enjoyed it as much as I did."  # Generated from value "The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins

 I finished reading Twilight today. Took me about a day to read as it is such a quick read. I'm sure you've all read this. I put it off as long as possible. 
 I have a friend who had never read the Harry Potter series. She promised me she would read it if I read the Twilight series, so here I am. 
 I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Did I enjoy this? For a young reader, yes. I think it's more suited for high schoolers and younger. For adults? Meh. Here's my thoughts 
 It's a love story with a vampire. The beginning I thought was cute as it brought back the fun innocence of a crush (I've been married for a while now so this was fun to relive). Ex. The excitement of simply being in the same room or standing next to a person. I found that enduring. But once they had kissed, I saw red flags. Edward never let her make decisions. He always was telling her what was best for her, despite her protests... but she doesn't fight him too hard. You'd think after a while she'd get fed up. I would. Edward also couldn't keep his story straight. Ex. "I promise I'll be with you for forever. You'll never be alone. I love you." Then a few paragraphs later we get "It's not safe for you to be with me. We shouldn't be together." This happens continually throughout the book. His wishy-washy back and forth attitude was so reminiscent of high school dating. (Hence why I felt this was suited for a younger audience - you know this is the drama they crave). {I'm not denying I was like this. It's just obnoxious now} 
 Now Jacob. He wasn't in it too much. However, he actually asked and listened to what's Bella wanted. And he complimented her (Edward didn't always return compliments). And he made her relax. I also hated how he grew exponentially while she was away (she came back and he's 6'2"). I don't know of anyone who has a growth spurt that extreme. 
 I don't know which team I'm on yet as this first book doesn't really present you with an either-or conundrum. It was all about Bella and Edward. So I remain neutral. 
 Lastly, they left a loose end that bothered me. Bella calls her mom and leaves a voicemail frantically asking her to call before returning home. It turns out the bad guy intercepted it and responded. However, after he dies, mom shows up at the hospital to see Bella and never once mentions the voicemail. There's no way she wouldn't have called her moms cell phone. I know cell phones existed in this story because Bella used one to call her mom. And if she knew her mom wasn't home, why leave a message on a home message machine (plus - who even had those anymore?). So... mom should've clued in to the crazy that was going down in Phoenix. That bugged me. 
 Alright your Twilight fans. Do your worst. Tear me apart."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere. Girl meets boy. Boy barely manages to avoid eating girl. Boy and girl fall in love with each other. Boy stalks girl. Girl's okay with that. Boy probably won't kill girl, but he's making no promises. It's got a lot I like in a book passionate, chaste love-triangle-free romance (for the most part, if you stick to the first book); fantasy with a new perspective; excitement; a lot of pages. It's also repetitive, problematic, badly written. I was pretty surprised to see that I for the first time I couldn't enjoy it as much as before. Largely because for the first time, I read Edward as having no redeeming qualities. 
 Edward Cullen is cold. I'm not talking about his stone lips. I never realized before how mean and uncaring he is. Anytime Bella is uncomfortable or unhappy, he's laughing at her. Intellectually, I knew that the Edward/Bella relationship is abusive and controlling. But I didn't realize how much Edward uses that awful put-the-girl-down-to-make-her-like-you technique. Ugh. Edward Cullen is definitely not what Twilight has going for it. 
 Here's where Twilight's strengths are: The romantic/sexual tension in this book is largely very good. While I didn't find the meadow scene particularly compelling this go around, the build up to the first kiss is excellent. 
 The book really feels like two different books. The first chapter through the baseball scene, plus the epilogue feel like one book, while the prologue and baseball scene to the last chapter has a totally different tone. While somewhat suspenseful, the first portion is a meandering romance, while the latter portion feels like a somewhat dull thriller. 
 Overall, I wouldn't stop recommending this to fans of romance who can handle cheese. Although a handout identifying warning signs of abusive relationships nearby on the shelf wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm sure it's not my last reread, either. 
 Why people turn on Twilight: 
 -embarrassment because/ feeling of betrayal that they had liked Edward 
 -Breaking Dawn There are so many things embarrassingly much worse about that book compared to the rest of the series. It breaks all the rules of the world that have been set up previously. Everything about Renesmee from her name to existence is ridiculous. And things with Jacob get very squicky. 
 -because it inspires feverous praise, and then later people are embarrassed they praised it so much when they realize how flawed its writing/romance is 
 -because it's just plain kind of embarrassingly cheesy"  # Generated from value "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere.

         hasContent "A must read, this book is from the eyes of a child. This book provides a window into all levels of hypocrisy entrenched in human behaviour. Atticus finch is perhaps one of the best father figures to shape men of fiction and reality after. He embodies what it is like to live in a dual and still somehow be right and grow noble children. Apart from the central tale of what humans are collectively possible of, there are many other pluses to the Novel. 
 The narrative is very convincing and the portrayal as well as character development is quite well done. The use of humor is also quite good. A thoroughly enjoyable book."  # Generated from value "A must read, this book is from the eyes of a child. This book provides a window into all levels of hypocrisy entrenched in human behaviour.

         hasContent "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still. As hard as it may be to fathom this, I didn't know anything about the novel other than its Great Depression, Deep South setting. It is certainly eye opening today to hear the liberal use of racial epithets (the N word most notably) although it is certainly in keeping with the times and the location. 
 As much as I am fighting against it, I am a literary philistine when it comes to classic fiction. I spend most of my leisure reading time on non-fiction of all types so my reviews and ratings are often filtered through that lens. I very much enjoyed this novel, speaking as it does to the vile force that was and is racism in this country. Atticus Finch is certainly a worthy hero and I can see why this book is often taught in schools, despite the racism that is front and center. Atticus' attitude and belief system is admirable and his integrity shines through the whole narrative. His is certainly an attitude to life worth emulating. 
 The plot is not complex, taking place over three years but the racial themes, the loss of innocence, the lack of real justice and the humanity that runs through the narrator's father certainly make it pretty gripping reading. I am glad I read it and feel better informed, in my own small way, on a subject that is viscerally important to my liberal, bleeding heart!"  # Generated from value "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still.

         hasContent "** spoiler alert ** 
 Angels & Demons... 
 This Dan Brown should be proud of himself...really. 
 This book and Da Vinci Code got me thinking...who the hell Dan Brown is. What is his academic background? I guess if the Illuminati ever came back to life and intended the wipe out Catholicism, they would drain their brains as they might but they wouldn't be able to come up with a plot as perfect and devilish as that of Dan Brown. This guy knows more than professors of history, physicists and religion men do; or at least he is a damn good researcher with an exceptional knowledge of rare fields like symbology and cryptography and a deep understanding of art, history and religions. It takes a smart professor of symbology to solve the riddles in the novel, but it takes a genius writer to create these riddles in the first place. Dan Brown is a genius. He really is. The air of mystery and apprehension in the novel is masterfully crafted that it engrossed me even when I off the book. I have to admit, I suspected all the characters. I suspected ALL of them except Langdon and Vittoria. I had to keep a computer close by so that every now and then I'd check google and youtube on scientific terms and historical facts. For me, this novel was not just a book; it was a whole experience. 
 Five stars...Yes. I fully enjoyed it... it is fairly long but you wouldn't wish it to end. My impression is mainly positive except for two points. The work as a whole deserves 5 stars nonetheless. 
 What I have to comment on rather than criticism is (spoilers coming ahead) 1) the Hassassin; the stereotypical sex-crazy terrorist barbaric Muslim Arab! Being a Muslim Arab, I felt offended. Plus... Come one Dan Brown, I guess you know better. The Hassassins, though considered a Shittii sect, were not at all religious. So I doubt that their descendants would in any way hold grudges against the church for sending the Crusaders centuries ago. And the few Arabic words the guy used - just to sound Arab - are of the Egyptian Dialect, while the Hassassins descendants, if any, would never be Egyptians. This might sound trivial (and this is why I didn't let this point affect my review) but the second point... I guess the director of the film version of the book would agree with me ... has to do with logic of events. Spinning over 128 chapters, the story was about a plot masterminded and carried out by a secret society; the Illuminati are many; they infiltrate organizations and hence, they are capable of carrying out an attack with the scale of that described in the novel; they can infiltrate the CERN, the Vatican; church, archives; monuments and all, the can infiltrate the Swiss Guard and the Vatican Police. This I understand. But reaching the end (folded in ONLY 9 chapters out of 137), it turned out that the whole plot was the work of a single guy! He is powerful; but he is one still. He imagined the full scenario and he had motives (a little bit overrated - but I think the author is implying that he was psychologically troubled). But when I tried to reconstruct the story from the new view point (that the camerlengo was the one behind the whole thing because he believed that the popessssss are not truly faithful to God), I had many questions that I couldn't find answers to; How did he recruit the Hassassin? Really? He did the whole thing in less then a month. How did he get that illuminati Muslim Arab Hassassin and convinced him to carry this out in revenge for his ancestors? In the film, the assassin did it for money, which was logical. But in the novel? It was all out of faith and loyalty. 2) How did he infiltrate the the CERN? Money? Maybe ..it just needed to be made clear. Guess to my humble mind, this is a very difficult fortress to break into. And finally, when the Hassassin called in the camerlengo's office, did he not recognize the guy's voice, since their relationship was only telephonic? Should I comment on Langdon's surviving a 3 mile fall from the helicopter? No, I won't. I still enjoyed the book greatly and still recommend it to everyone."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "It has been so long since I have read a book that I couldn't put down. In 2016 I had a REALLY good book year, handing out 4 and 5-star reviews all over the shop. So far 2017 has been a disappointing 8 months until now. I am so in love with EVERYTHING about this book (and am so happy I finally got round to it; it has been on my reading list for years). 
 I am currently making my way through "The Complete Novels of Jane Austen" (all 1278 pages of it) and Pride and Prejudice is book 2 of 7. Sense and Sensibility was first and although I appreciated Austen's humour and writing, I was not a fan of this novel. 
 So imagine my sheer delight when I loved P&P from page 1. There is laugh-out-loud humour, scandal, insufferable characters, loveable characters, and of course romance. I loved the way Austen developed the characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet who I see to be intelligent and smart, full of integrity, and quite the feminist. 
 Next up is book 3/7 Mansfield Park."  # Generated from value "It has been so long since I have read a book that I couldn't put down.

         hasContent "Pride and Prejudice is the formula for the modern chick-flick. A man and a woman who have no chance of being together, and for most of the story do not even like each other, find themselves drawn in more and more by each other and in the end live happily ever after. It is an overused premise nowadays, but I do have to give credit to Jane Austen seeing as she wrote it in 1813 and its basic plot structure has been copied a million different times, just proves her genius. I thought it also cleverly makes fun of the ridiculous social constructs of the time and the manner in which people are expected to address one another. This last point can get lost in the old English writing"  # Generated from value "Pride and Prejudice is the formula for the modern chick-flick.

         hasContent "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read. My thoughts after reading this? I am still not sure... 
 Overall this book was an entertaining exciting read where if you ignore the fictional world and its gaps, it was pretty good for about 3/4 of it. At first I was concerned since the first 80 pages or so reminded me of a retelling of The Giver. I found too many similarities in the plot that bothered me but eventually I overlooked that and enjoyed the quick fun read. 
 I have to admit I found Tris really dumb at times and would roll my eyes at parts so I am not too attached to her as a main character. 
 Reading along, I was hoping that this would be one of the first dystopian novels I would love - but then like all the other novels similar to this - the plot gets weird and force-fed to the reader. We happily follow a solid plot then it twists to something messed up AND just as we learn characters, the author kills them off. 
 I am still confused on how I feel about this book as I really enjoyed majority of it BUT I hope this isnt a series that gets even more messed up that completely derails."  # Generated from value "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read.

         hasContent "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency. 
 The book is turned out to be so effective. Whether it's the sympathy driven success since a young girl who seems to be very refine writer got snatched the right to flourish naturally. Or it is real good write up. 
 I liked it because my rational mind accepts it rather than the emotional part would be swayed away by the ordeal of the girl. 
 At the age of 13 she is reading mythology and studying different languages. Reading was such a heavy part of her life, and not some ordinary reading (language, philosophy etc). The way she endured pain during hiding, thought critically and drew opinions based on her knowledge, reviewing books in a context that was related to her ordeal/life is something I held on to very dearly while reading. She had a clear idea what she wanted to do once they finish the hiding (spending time in Germany and London to get education on history of arts, languages). Some of the ideas like, 'the old people supposed to be less confused since they dealt with the hard part already and have pretty much worked out their ways than the younger evolving youth' and 'when you are upset, instead of holding on to the people who are miserable since their misery can make you realize the blessings in your life, one should rely on the happiness and colours around' are quite fascinating. She use to go back to the old entries in diary and see her complaining self which she found as "ungrateful". 
 The end makes me wonder how terrified she must had felt when they were caught and above all how desperate she had been to leave her dear kitty behind. How she had lived the next 6-7 months without writing. Her intellectual self-had the need to shed itself. How she had kept insanity without talking to Kitty, since that was one major thing which kept her going. 
 Anyhow, in the end, Kitty did do justice by bringing Anne Frank to the world. Otherwise we would have never known the intelligent girl like many others who must had been lost in evil-selfish human warmongering conquests."  # Generated from value "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency. 
 The book is turned out to be so effective. Whether it's the sympathy driven success since a young girl who seems to be very refine writer got snatched the right to flourish naturally. Or it is real good write up. 
 I liked it because my rational mind accepts it rather than the emotional part would be swayed away by the ordeal of the girl. 
 At the age of 13 she is reading mythology and studying different languages. Reading was such a heavy part of her life, and not some ordinary reading (language, philosophy etc). The way she endured pain during hiding, thought critically and drew opinions based on her knowledge, reviewing books in a context that was related to her ordeal/life is something I held on to very dearly while reading. She had a clear idea what she wanted to do once they finish the hiding (spending time in Germany and London to get education on history of arts, languages). Some of the ideas like, 'the old people supposed to be less confused since they dealt with the hard part already and have pretty much worked out their ways than the younger evolving youth' and 'when you are upset, instead of holding on to the people who are miserable since their misery can make you realize the blessings in your life, one should rely on the happiness and colours around' are quite fascinating. She use to go back to the old entries in diary and see her complaining self which she found as "ungrateful". 
 The end makes me wonder how terrified she must had felt when they were caught and above all how desperate she had been to leave her dear kitty behind. How she had lived the next 6-7 months without writing. Her intellectual self-had the need to shed itself. How she had kept insanity without talking to Kitty, since that was one major thing which kept her going. 
 Anyhow, in the end, Kitty did do justice by bringing Anne Frank to the world. Otherwise we would have never known the intelligent girl like many others who must had been lost in evil-selfish human warmongering conquests." located at cell 'reviews'!E53.,

How many young teenagers are so eloquent, so self-conscious, so tenacious and so aware of the people that surround them? Anne, at a very young age, managed not only to understand but also to express many human truths--truths that range from mundane topics such as everyday life and relationships and politics to topics that even some critical-thinking adults can't seem to grasp, like life and death, peace and war, depression and happiness. 
 Anne Frank achieved a lot. She sent a message to the World, a message that, if only half the people listened to, would make this a better place. Oh--but she could have achieved so much more. Her story makes me feel both distressed and optimistic. I would recommend this book to anyone."  # Generated from value "It's difficult to explain at what level this book touched me.

 UGH. This one was the worst... 
 I honestly don't know why this book is so highly rated. This one was definitely the worst of the three. It was a complete repeat of book one. I liked the beginning where she was starting to get little hints and glimpses that there was a rebellion starting in some of the districts. That part was exciting and I wanted to watch more of that unfold, but before I knew it we were back in the God damned arena. And then it was exactly like the first book, people dying all over the place, alliances being formed, and knowing all along that she's going to figure some way out of there for her and Peeta. She kept rambling on about sacrificing herself for Peeta and her martyrdom was SO.FUCKING.ANNOYING. We all knew she and Peeta weren't going to die. There was so much "action" in this one that I didn't even get a chance to care about anyone else in the arena with her. So as people were dying, even ones in her alliance, I did not find myself caring all that much. Maybe I had resigned myself to the belief that they might all die (except Katniss and Peeta) so I didn't allow myself to get attached to any of them. 
 So my advice would be to skip a whole bunch of chapters until they figure out how to blow up the arena and then pick it back up there. Then it gets more interesting again. But I felt left out of the uprising, left out of the "Catching Fire" that was the title of the book. We see little glimpses and then by the time they get rescued it's all out war. We don't get to see how the action in the arena has influenced the people of the districts and the rebellion. So I thought it was a lot of lazy writing. A lot of missed opportunities by going back into the arena. It could have been so much better if Katniss and Peeta had been mentors to the games, and we could have been involved in the rebellion alliance and then we could have been a part of the arena AND been better positioned to get information of the districts' uprising. She could have formed many of the same bonds with the other past tributes by way of her tribute forming alliances with theirs. But I guess it's no good to dwell on all the ways you could have written a better sequel. Anywho I don't have a lot else to say about this one."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

This story that Collins has created, one about oppression and government control, rebellion and fighting for freedom, is so well done. There is never a dull moment. Everything that happens is happening for a reason, and the pacing is just perfect. 
 I know many people are upset that Katniss lost her "badassery-ness" from the first book, but really, this just made me connect with and understand her even more. What she went through in the first Games, and all the terrible stuff afterwards, is horrifying. Of course it's going to affect her. So many characters nowadays don't seem to feel anything - they just push away all the bad thoughts and keep fighting. They're kinda like Gale, in a way. Running on rage and not really taking in and dealing with all the bad. 
 Katniss isn't like that. What she went through, what she experienced, it affected her. It changed her. And that makes her character even more realistic. Friends were killed, she had to kill, she had to see the repercussions of her actions - these types of things affect you in ways you cannot imagine. She will never be just another girl from District 12. How could she be, after all she went through? 
 Collins has created a dynamic, complex cast of characters, and she is not afraid to kill them off. They are at war, after all. Death is to be expected. The only thing I'm not sure about is the last couple of chapters (not the epilogue). I like how everything resolved, just not sure in the way it resolved. But the more I think about it, the more I like it. Not a thing should be changed. 
 Also, I completely understand why Katniss did what she did, throughout the whole series. Any decisions she made, any actions she took, I understood her reasoning why, and almost always agreed with her. It's not easy to create a character in which readers truly understand, but Collins has done it here. She created a personality for Katniss that, while it did change based on what happened around her, the base of her character was always there. Splendid job in that regard. 
 Now, the epilogue. Maybe some people hate it, but honestly, I love it. It's so extremely powerful, and that last line? Yeah, that's a last sentence that I will always remember, word for word. It is the perfect way to end this series. Bravo, Suzanne Collins. Bravo.

 Well that escalated quickly! This one was my favorite of the series.... 
 Talk about a 180! The last book was boring and unimpressive, people were dying everywhere but I didn't give a fuck. This one, just the opposite. Almost all of my favorite characters die. It was sad, it was painful, it had emotion. Raw, real, guttural emotion. 
 I thought Suzanne Collins painted a pretty good picture of war. Particularly that there are no winners in war. We are introduced to district thirteen and immediately made uncomfortable by their militarized governing. There are so many rules here that it's almost worse than living in the districts. Though no one is left to die in the streets the way they were in district 12, there are very few real freedoms here. There's definitely subtle (or maybe not so subtle) stabs at both extreme conservative capitalism (in Panem there's no regulation and no gov't assistance, it's every man for himself) and extreme communism (in district 13 everyone eats exactly the number of calories they need, and everyone wears the same clothes and is provided identical living quarters). Suzanne Collins artfully shows how both extremes lead back to the same tyranny and oppression. We wanted so desperately to believe that district 13 was some kind of utopia of freedom, but in their attempt to be the exact opposite of the capitol and everything it stood for, they turned themselves into the capitol. 
 We are also introduced to another leader of the people, Coin. Katniss isn't sure what to make of her and neither are we. I wish she had delved a little more completely into the corruption of power, because by the time we meet Coin we are already a little leery of her and her motivations. As the book goes on we get to see more and more that Coin is not a friend to Katniss and by the end we don't believe that Coin is going to be any better than Snow as a leader of Panem. I cheered when Katniss took her down. 
 Katniss was suffering from a clear case of PTSD throughout this book, and considering all she went through up until this book (and then a shit-ton more during this book!) she deserved to be a little out of sorts. It made her even more real than the first two books could have. She was vulnerable and unsure and not the picture of the rebellion that district thirteen wanted her to be. In some ways I was disappointed that she didn't take over the capitol herself, but in others I am really glad that she didn't. I hated that her sister died, but it was the perfect catalyst to bring Katniss to question what she was a part of. If her sister hadn't died, she wouldn't have been lead down the path of discovering just who Coin was and what she was capable of doing. I like that Katniss was a complete mess after it all went down. Like I said before, there are no winners in war."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert ** 
 Well that escalated quickly! This one was my favorite of the series.... 
 Talk about a 180! The last book was boring and unimpressive, people were dying everywhere but I didn't give a fuck. This one, just the opposite. Almost all of my favorite characters die. It was sad, it was painful, it had emotion. Raw, real, guttural emotion. 
 I thought Suzanne Collins painted a pretty good picture of war. Particularly that there are no winners in war. We are introduced to district thirteen and immediately made uncomfortable by their militarized governing. There are so many rules here that it's almost worse than living in the districts. Though no one is left to die in the streets the way they were in district 12, there are very few real freedoms here. There's definitely subtle (or maybe not so subtle) stabs at both extreme conservative capitalism (in Panem there's no regulation and no gov't assistance, it's every man for himself) and extreme communism (in district 13 everyone eats exactly the number of calories they need, and everyone wears the same clothes and is provided identical living quarters). Suzanne Collins artfully shows how both extremes lead back to the same tyranny and oppression. We wanted so desperately to believe that district 13 was some kind of utopia of freedom, but in their attempt to be the exact opposite of the capitol and everything it stood for, they turned themselves into the capitol.

 OMG. Everyone loves Katniss and she has no idea why. I have no idea either.... 
 Okay, right off the bat I have to admit that the love triangle drove me absolutely crazy. Peeta or Gale? Who the fuck cares? BUT I can say that I thought there was care in how Suzanne Collins explained the Katniss love. I would have really rolled my eyes if Peeta had said "there's just something different about her." I thought it was much better to tell that his dad was in love with her mom and pointed Katniss out to Peeta when he was young. Also the dad showed Katniss special favor when she sold him her game. Okay, this makes it a more believable situation where she would catch Peeta's attention. The fact that her and Gale formed a bond naturally around hunting is passable too. But the whole best friend turned lover thing is tired and boring, but forgivable I guess. 
 NOW THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY... I do like the dystopian setting of this book. The way that the capitol keeps control of the country and the citizens through zero tolerance patriotism, and the yearly punishment of forcing children to fight to the death in an arena while the games are broadcast to the entire nation. Considering the premise I didn't think the book was quite as dark as I had expected. I am not sure what I expected, but I can see why this is still acceptable among YA readers. 
 I did take a little bit of issue with the arena ending. I read all three books before writing these reviews so I can see why they made the arena ending the way they did. BUT I also think that because they made such a big deal about people being drawn to the love story between Katniss and Peeta, that to take away their promise of two survivors and to force one of them to kill the other at the end of the games might have been enough to spark a rebellion anyway. 
 I had a love/hate relationship with Katniss as a character. I think in this book I mostly liked her. Though I thought she was immature at times I had to remind myself that she was only supposed to be 16 or 17 years old. I thought many elements of her character were overplayed stereotypes. The strong young girl who pays no attention to boys, and is temperamental and harsh but still manages to have two boys in love with her at the same time. Old and tired. Why can't she be those things MINUS the attention from boys. We don't need to teach our daughters that they are validated because someone loves them despite their being bitchy and off-putting. And she was kinda bitchy and off-putting. I suppose that isn't much different from a typical teenage girl in a lot of ways, but maybe if we rewarded our characters for kindness over aloofness we may influence our teens to be kinder and less aloof. Maybe not. But I digress... there were elements of her that were admirable. Her undying love and protection of her sister and her bond with Rue in the arena showed that she did have a softer, kinder side that she reserved for only a few. She had some character flaws and vulnerabilities which made her more realistic and likeable. I was drawn into her story and wanted to read on to the rest of the series to find out what happens with her."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

Okay, this makes it a more believable situation where she would catch Peeta's attention. The fact that her and Gale formed a bond naturally around hunting is passable too. But the whole best friend turned lover thing is tired and boring, but forgivable I guess. 
 NOW THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY... I do like the dystopian setting of this book. The way that the capitol keeps control of the country and the citizens through zero tolerance patriotism, and the yearly punishment of forcing children to fight to the death in an arena while the games are broadcast to the entire nation. Considering the premise I didn't think the book was quite as dark as I had expected. I am not sure what I expected, but I can see why this is still acceptable among YA readers. 
 I did take a little bit of issue with the arena ending. I read all three books before writing these reviews so I can see why they made the arena ending the way they did. BUT I also think that because they made such a big deal about people being drawn to the love story between Katniss and Peeta, that to take away their promise of two survivors and to force one of them to kill the other at the end of the games might have been enough to spark a rebellion anyway. 
 I had a love/hate relationship with Katniss as a character. I think in this book I mostly liked her. Though I thought she was immature at times I had to remind myself that she was only supposed to be 16 or 17 years old. I thought many elements of her character were overplayed stereotypes. The strong young girl who pays no attention to boys, and is temperamental and harsh but still manages to have two boys in love with her at the same time. Old and tired. Why can't she be those things MINUS the attention from boys. We don't need to teach our daughters that they are validated because someone loves them despite their being bitchy and off-putting. And she was kinda bitchy and off-putting. I suppose that isn't much different from a typical teenage girl in a lot of ways, but maybe if we rewarded our characters for kindness over aloofness we may influence our teens to be kinder and less aloof. Maybe not. But I digress... there were elements of her that were admirable. Her undying love and protection of her sister and her bond with Rue in the arena showed that she did have a softer, kinder side that she reserved for only a few. She had some character flaws and vulnerabilities which made her more realistic and likeable. I was drawn into her story and wanted to read on to the rest of the series to find out what happens with her." located at cell 'reviews'!E3.,

         hasContent "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man". But I recently came across Junot Diaz's reading list for his writing class and noticed "The Hunger Games" there. It sparked curiosity and an assumption that if the plot was cheesy, at least this story would be a good model for writing. Indeed, it is an excellent model. The story is well-paced, compelling, and full of content. At first I thought that the themes of trust and friendship would undergird all the action and page-turning suspense. Yet I was pleased to see the critical commentary on modern society that Collin's hit on, especially the disgusting effects of reality TV, namely the sick level of exploitation in entertainment and the lack of empathy from those who control and profit from the system. Also, I liked how, through Katniss, the author lays bare our sense of audience-- that the characters have no privacy and their lives are constantly broadcasted for public consumption. I think this is very relevant, especially for young readers, with the dominance of online social media. Nor does Collin's miss the opportunity to make subtle yet clear comments on classism and inequality between the Districts. The only criticism I have is that I did not really like the voice of the narrator. Katniss is not particularly endearing, but sharp and practical. The character even describes herself as coming across as "heartless." Perhaps-- as the traditional gender roles have been reversed-- this is part of her survival adaptation, and winning the games proves her tact correct. Overall, I was impressed with the layers of meaning in this YA novel and it's entertainment value, despite its already being a huge commercial success."  # Generated from value "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man".

 4.5 out of 5 stars 
 SPOILERS! But really I doubt you haven't read it yet! 
 So how can I review a book that's been read by everyone and made into movies love by everyone? LIKE THIS 
 This book takes place in a dystopian American society. The country now has a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer districts that only exist to produce goods for the capital. This novel centers around Katniss, a girl from the coal mining district 12. She's very poor and has to provide for her family in order for them to survive. Also In this society every year the Capitol has a competition called The Hunger Games. In these games, teenagers from all twelve districts are picked from a "reaping" and forced to fight to the death in these games. This is because before this society was created, the districts tried to rebel against the capitol and reach independence. When they failed, the Hunger games were created as punishment. This year, Katniss' younger sister is chosen. Rather than watch her sister be killed, she volunteers to go to the games in her place. 
 Now here's what I liked. Katniss. I LOVE Katniss. She's strong, she's practical, and she breaks down every single trope of YA heroines that you can think of. The book is in her POV. Part of the fun of the book is getting inside her head to see how she strategizes and how she reacts to the cruelty of the games. I also liked how district life felt almost historical, like it took place in the past. Then we get to the Capitol and it feels like science fiction. Then when we get to the actual games it feels like a survival story. The fact that all the sub-genres are seamlessly woven together is what makes this book so fun to read. It was fast paced and had wonderful side characters as well. 
 Now here are some things I, not disliked, but kind of expected more of because of all the hype. First, Rue's death was a little anti-climactic. I expected it to have more of an impact on Katniss than it did. Another thing was Peeta. I spent most of the book thinking that , like Katniss, he was faking the whole being in love thing. But him really being in love with her felt a little unnecessary. At least in this book. I felt it might've fit in later books. And there was one thing I really didn't understand. WTF WERE THE WOLF PEOPLE? Were they just designed to look like the dead tributes? Or were they the dead tributes made into wolf people? I don't understand. 
 So there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been already said. I really enjoyed the book, I had to read it for an English class. Still haven't seen the movie, will watch it today probably. And I hope everyone else has read it and enjoyed it as much as I did."  # Generated from value "The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins

 I finished reading Twilight today. Took me about a day to read as it is such a quick read. I'm sure you've all read this. I put it off as long as possible. 
 I have a friend who had never read the Harry Potter series. She promised me she would read it if I read the Twilight series, so here I am. 
 I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Did I enjoy this? For a young reader, yes. I think it's more suited for high schoolers and younger. For adults? Meh. Here's my thoughts 
 It's a love story with a vampire. The beginning I thought was cute as it brought back the fun innocence of a crush (I've been married for a while now so this was fun to relive). Ex. The excitement of simply being in the same room or standing next to a person. I found that enduring. But once they had kissed, I saw red flags. Edward never let her make decisions. He always was telling her what was best for her, despite her protests... but she doesn't fight him too hard. You'd think after a while she'd get fed up. I would. Edward also couldn't keep his story straight. Ex. "I promise I'll be with you for forever. You'll never be alone. I love you." Then a few paragraphs later we get "It's not safe for you to be with me. We shouldn't be together." This happens continually throughout the book. His wishy-washy back and forth attitude was so reminiscent of high school dating. (Hence why I felt this was suited for a younger audience - you know this is the drama they crave). {I'm not denying I was like this. It's just obnoxious now} 
 Now Jacob. He wasn't in it too much. However, he actually asked and listened to what's Bella wanted. And he complimented her (Edward didn't always return compliments). And he made her relax. I also hated how he grew exponentially while she was away (she came back and he's 6'2"). I don't know of anyone who has a growth spurt that extreme. 
 I don't know which team I'm on yet as this first book doesn't really present you with an either-or conundrum. It was all about Bella and Edward. So I remain neutral. 
 Lastly, they left a loose end that bothered me. Bella calls her mom and leaves a voicemail frantically asking her to call before returning home. It turns out the bad guy intercepted it and responded. However, after he dies, mom shows up at the hospital to see Bella and never once mentions the voicemail. There's no way she wouldn't have called her moms cell phone. I know cell phones existed in this story because Bella used one to call her mom. And if she knew her mom wasn't home, why leave a message on a home message machine (plus - who even had those anymore?). So... mom should've clued in to the crazy that was going down in Phoenix. That bugged me. 
 Alright your Twilight fans. Do your worst. Tear me apart."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere. Girl meets boy. Boy barely manages to avoid eating girl. Boy and girl fall in love with each other. Boy stalks girl. Girl's okay with that. Boy probably won't kill girl, but he's making no promises. It's got a lot I like in a book passionate, chaste love-triangle-free romance (for the most part, if you stick to the first book); fantasy with a new perspective; excitement; a lot of pages. It's also repetitive, problematic, badly written. I was pretty surprised to see that I for the first time I couldn't enjoy it as much as before. Largely because for the first time, I read Edward as having no redeeming qualities. 
 Edward Cullen is cold. I'm not talking about his stone lips. I never realized before how mean and uncaring he is. Anytime Bella is uncomfortable or unhappy, he's laughing at her. Intellectually, I knew that the Edward/Bella relationship is abusive and controlling. But I didn't realize how much Edward uses that awful put-the-girl-down-to-make-her-like-you technique. Ugh. Edward Cullen is definitely not what Twilight has going for it. 
 Here's where Twilight's strengths are: The romantic/sexual tension in this book is largely very good. While I didn't find the meadow scene particularly compelling this go around, the build up to the first kiss is excellent. 
 The book really feels like two different books. The first chapter through the baseball scene, plus the epilogue feel like one book, while the prologue and baseball scene to the last chapter has a totally different tone. While somewhat suspenseful, the first portion is a meandering romance, while the latter portion feels like a somewhat dull thriller. 
 Overall, I wouldn't stop recommending this to fans of romance who can handle cheese. Although a handout identifying warning signs of abusive relationships nearby on the shelf wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm sure it's not my last reread, either. 
 Why people turn on Twilight: 
 -embarrassment because/ feeling of betrayal that they had liked Edward 
 -Breaking Dawn There are so many things embarrassingly much worse about that book compared to the rest of the series. It breaks all the rules of the world that have been set up previously. Everything about Renesmee from her name to existence is ridiculous. And things with Jacob get very squicky. 
 -because it inspires feverous praise, and then later people are embarrassed they praised it so much when they realize how flawed its writing/romance is 
 -because it's just plain kind of embarrassingly cheesy"  # Generated from value "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere. Girl meets boy. Boy barely manages to avoid eating girl. Boy and girl fall in love with each other. Boy stalks girl. Girl's okay with that. Boy probably won't kill girl, but he's making no promises. It's got a lot I like in a book passionate, chaste love-triangle-free romance (for the most part, if you stick to the first book); fantasy with a new perspective; excitement; a lot of pages. It's also repetitive, problematic, badly written. I was pretty surprised to see that I for the first time I couldn't enjoy it as much as before. Largely because for the first time, I read Edward as having no redeeming qualities. 
 Edward Cullen is cold. I'm not talking about his stone lips. I never realized before how mean and uncaring he is. Anytime Bella is uncomfortable or unhappy, he's laughing at her. Intellectually, I knew that the Edward/Bella relationship is abusive and controlling. But I didn't realize how much Edward uses that awful put-the-girl-down-to-make-her-like-you technique. Ugh. Edward Cullen is definitely not what Twilight has going for it.

Atticus finch is perhaps one of the best father figures to shape men of fiction and reality after. He embodies what it is like to live in a dual and still somehow be right and grow noble children. Apart from the central tale of what humans are collectively possible of, there are many other pluses to the Novel. 
 The narrative is very convincing and the portrayal as well as character development is quite well done. The use of humor is also quite good.

         hasContent "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still. As hard as it may be to fathom this, I didn't know anything about the novel other than its Great Depression, Deep South setting. It is certainly eye opening today to hear the liberal use of racial epithets (the N word most notably) although it is certainly in keeping with the times and the location. 
 As much as I am fighting against it, I am a literary philistine when it comes to classic fiction. I spend most of my leisure reading time on non-fiction of all types so my reviews and ratings are often filtered through that lens. I very much enjoyed this novel, speaking as it does to the vile force that was and is racism in this country. Atticus Finch is certainly a worthy hero and I can see why this book is often taught in schools, despite the racism that is front and center. Atticus' attitude and belief system is admirable and his integrity shines through the whole narrative. His is certainly an attitude to life worth emulating. 
 The plot is not complex, taking place over three years but the racial themes, the loss of innocence, the lack of real justice and the humanity that runs through the narrator's father certainly make it pretty gripping reading. I am glad I read it and feel better informed, in my own small way, on a subject that is viscerally important to my liberal, bleeding heart!"  # Generated from value "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still.

 Angels & Demons... 
 This Dan Brown should be proud of himself...really. 
 This book and Da Vinci Code got me thinking...who the hell Dan Brown is. What is his academic background? I guess if the Illuminati ever came back to life and intended the wipe out Catholicism, they would drain their brains as they might but they wouldn't be able to come up with a plot as perfect and devilish as that of Dan Brown. This guy knows more than professors of history, physicists and religion men do; or at least he is a damn good researcher with an exceptional knowledge of rare fields like symbology and cryptography and a deep understanding of art, history and religions. It takes a smart professor of symbology to solve the riddles in the novel, but it takes a genius writer to create these riddles in the first place. Dan Brown is a genius. He really is. The air of mystery and apprehension in the novel is masterfully crafted that it engrossed me even when I off the book. I have to admit, I suspected all the characters. I suspected ALL of them except Langdon and Vittoria. I had to keep a computer close by so that every now and then I'd check google and youtube on scientific terms and historical facts. For me, this novel was not just a book; it was a whole experience. 
 Five stars...Yes. I fully enjoyed it... it is fairly long but you wouldn't wish it to end. My impression is mainly positive except for two points. The work as a whole deserves 5 stars nonetheless. 
 What I have to comment on rather than criticism is (spoilers coming ahead) 1) the Hassassin; the stereotypical sex-crazy terrorist barbaric Muslim Arab! Being a Muslim Arab, I felt offended. Plus... Come one Dan Brown, I guess you know better. The Hassassins, though considered a Shittii sect, were not at all religious. So I doubt that their descendants would in any way hold grudges against the church for sending the Crusaders centuries ago. And the few Arabic words the guy used - just to sound Arab - are of the Egyptian Dialect, while the Hassassins descendants, if any, would never be Egyptians. This might sound trivial (and this is why I didn't let this point affect my review) but the second point... I guess the director of the film version of the book would agree with me ... has to do with logic of events. Spinning over 128 chapters, the story was about a plot masterminded and carried out by a secret society; the Illuminati are many; they infiltrate organizations and hence, they are capable of carrying out an attack with the scale of that described in the novel; they can infiltrate the CERN, the Vatican; church, archives; monuments and all, the can infiltrate the Swiss Guard and the Vatican Police. This I understand. But reaching the end (folded in ONLY 9 chapters out of 137), it turned out that the whole plot was the work of a single guy! He is powerful; but he is one still. He imagined the full scenario and he had motives (a little bit overrated - but I think the author is implying that he was psychologically troubled). But when I tried to reconstruct the story from the new view point (that the camerlengo was the one behind the whole thing because he believed that the popessssss are not truly faithful to God), I had many questions that I couldn't find answers to; How did he recruit the Hassassin? Really? He did the whole thing in less then a month. How did he get that illuminati Muslim Arab Hassassin and convinced him to carry this out in revenge for his ancestors? In the film, the assassin did it for money, which was logical. But in the novel? It was all out of faith and loyalty. 2) How did he infiltrate the the CERN? Money? Maybe ..it just needed to be made clear. Guess to my humble mind, this is a very difficult fortress to break into. And finally, when the Hassassin called in the camerlengo's office, did he not recognize the guy's voice, since their relationship was only telephonic? Should I comment on Langdon's surviving a 3 mile fall from the helicopter? No, I won't. I still enjoyed the book greatly and still recommend it to everyone."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

 I am currently making my way through "The Complete Novels of Jane Austen" (all 1278 pages of it) and Pride and Prejudice is book 2 of 7. Sense and Sensibility was first and although I appreciated Austen's humour and writing, I was not a fan of this novel. 
 So imagine my sheer delight when I loved P&P from page 1. There is laugh-out-loud humour, scandal, insufferable characters, loveable characters, and of course romance. I loved the way Austen developed the characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet who I see to be intelligent and smart, full of integrity, and quite the feminist. 
 Next up is book 3/7 Mansfield Park."  # Generated from value "It has been so long since I have read a book that I couldn't put down.

         hasContent "Pride and Prejudice is the formula for the modern chick-flick. A man and a woman who have no chance of being together, and for most of the story do not even like each other, find themselves drawn in more and more by each other and in the end live happily ever after. It is an overused premise nowadays, but I do have to give credit to Jane Austen seeing as she wrote it in 1813 and its basic plot structure has been copied a million different times, just proves her genius. I thought it also cleverly makes fun of the ridiculous social constructs of the time and the manner in which people are expected to address one another. This last point can get lost in the old English writing"  # Generated from value "Pride and Prejudice is the formula for the modern chick-flick.

This also, by the way, signals the first time a BOOK kicked my embarrassment squick into gear. Between Mrs. Bennet and Lydia, I just about crawled out of my skin a few times.

         hasContent "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read. My thoughts after reading this? I am still not sure... 
 Overall this book was an entertaining exciting read where if you ignore the fictional world and its gaps, it was pretty good for about 3/4 of it. At first I was concerned since the first 80 pages or so reminded me of a retelling of The Giver. I found too many similarities in the plot that bothered me but eventually I overlooked that and enjoyed the quick fun read. 
 I have to admit I found Tris really dumb at times and would roll my eyes at parts so I am not too attached to her as a main character. 
 Reading along, I was hoping that this would be one of the first dystopian novels I would love - but then like all the other novels similar to this - the plot gets weird and force-fed to the reader. We happily follow a solid plot then it twists to something messed up AND just as we learn characters, the author kills them off. 
 I am still confused on how I feel about this book as I really enjoyed majority of it BUT I hope this isnt a series that gets even more messed up that completely derails."  # Generated from value "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read.

         hasContent "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency. 
 The book is turned out to be so effective. Whether it's the sympathy driven success since a young girl who seems to be very refine writer got snatched the right to flourish naturally. Or it is real good write up. 
 I liked it because my rational mind accepts it rather than the emotional part would be swayed away by the ordeal of the girl. 
 At the age of 13 she is reading mythology and studying different languages. Reading was such a heavy part of her life, and not some ordinary reading (language, philosophy etc). The way she endured pain during hiding, thought critically and drew opinions based on her knowledge, reviewing books in a context that was related to her ordeal/life is something I held on to very dearly while reading. She had a clear idea what she wanted to do once they finish the hiding (spending time in Germany and London to get education on history of arts, languages). Some of the ideas like, 'the old people supposed to be less confused since they dealt with the hard part already and have pretty much worked out their ways than the younger evolving youth' and 'when you are upset, instead of holding on to the people who are miserable since their misery can make you realize the blessings in your life, one should rely on the happiness and colours around' are quite fascinating. She use to go back to the old entries in diary and see her complaining self which she found as "ungrateful". 
 The end makes me wonder how terrified she must had felt when they were caught and above all how desperate she had been to leave her dear kitty behind. How she had lived the next 6-7 months without writing. Her intellectual self-had the need to shed itself. How she had kept insanity without talking to Kitty, since that was one major thing which kept her going. 
 Anyhow, in the end, Kitty did do justice by bringing Anne Frank to the world. Otherwise we would have never known the intelligent girl like many others who must had been lost in evil-selfish human warmongering conquests."  # Generated from value "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency.

How she had kept insanity without talking to Kitty, since that was one major thing which kept her going. 
 Anyhow, in the end, Kitty did do justice by bringing Anne Frank to the world. Otherwise we would have never known the intelligent girl like many others who must had been lost in evil-selfish human warmongering conquests." located at cell 'reviews'!E53.,

How many young teenagers are so eloquent, so self-conscious, so tenacious and so aware of the people that surround them? Anne, at a very young age, managed not only to understand but also to express many human truths--truths that range from mundane topics such as everyday life and relationships and politics to topics that even some critical-thinking adults can't seem to grasp, like life and death, peace and war, depression and happiness. 
 Anne Frank achieved a lot. She sent a message to the World, a message that, if only half the people listened to, would make this a better place. Oh--but she could have achieved so much more. Her story makes me feel both distressed and optimistic. I would recommend this book to anyone."  # Generated from value "It's difficult to explain at what level this book touched me.

 UGH. This one was the worst... 
 I honestly don't know why this book is so highly rated. This one was definitely the worst of the three. It was a complete repeat of book one. I liked the beginning where she was starting to get little hints and glimpses that there was a rebellion starting in some of the districts. That part was exciting and I wanted to watch more of that unfold, but before I knew it we were back in the God damned arena. And then it was exactly like the first book, people dying all over the place, alliances being formed, and knowing all along that she's going to figure some way out of there for her and Peeta. She kept rambling on about sacrificing herself for Peeta and her martyrdom was SO.FUCKING.ANNOYING. We all knew she and Peeta weren't going to die. There was so much "action" in this one that I didn't even get a chance to care about anyone else in the arena with her. So as people were dying, even ones in her alliance, I did not find myself caring all that much. Maybe I had resigned myself to the belief that they might all die (except Katniss and Peeta) so I didn't allow myself to get attached to any of them. 
 So my advice would be to skip a whole bunch of chapters until they figure out how to blow up the arena and then pick it back up there. Then it gets more interesting again. But I felt left out of the uprising, left out of the "Catching Fire" that was the title of the book. We see little glimpses and then by the time they get rescued it's all out war. We don't get to see how the action in the arena has influenced the people of the districts and the rebellion. So I thought it was a lot of lazy writing. A lot of missed opportunities by going back into the arena. It could have been so much better if Katniss and Peeta had been mentors to the games, and we could have been involved in the rebellion alliance and then we could have been a part of the arena AND been better positioned to get information of the districts' uprising. She could have formed many of the same bonds with the other past tributes by way of her tribute forming alliances with theirs. But I guess it's no good to dwell on all the ways you could have written a better sequel. Anywho I don't have a lot else to say about this one."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

I love too that defiance in the world of the hunger games is kindness and solidarity rather than blind self-interest and individualism. The whole series is a demented reversal of Gil Scot Heron's "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" in which the whole revolution is played out in hyperreality and simulacra, and not only the revolution, but the counter revolution will in fact be televised.

         hasContent "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it. This story that Collins has created, one about oppression and government control, rebellion and fighting for freedom, is so well done. There is never a dull moment. Everything that happens is happening for a reason, and the pacing is just perfect. 
 I know many people are upset that Katniss lost her "badassery-ness" from the first book, but really, this just made me connect with and understand her even more. What she went through in the first Games, and all the terrible stuff afterwards, is horrifying. Of course it's going to affect her. So many characters nowadays don't seem to feel anything - they just push away all the bad thoughts and keep fighting. They're kinda like Gale, in a way. Running on rage and not really taking in and dealing with all the bad. 
 Katniss isn't like that. What she went through, what she experienced, it affected her. It changed her. And that makes her character even more realistic. Friends were killed, she had to kill, she had to see the repercussions of her actions - these types of things affect you in ways you cannot imagine. She will never be just another girl from District 12. How could she be, after all she went through? 
 Collins has created a dynamic, complex cast of characters, and she is not afraid to kill them off. They are at war, after all. Death is to be expected. The only thing I'm not sure about is the last couple of chapters (not the epilogue). I like how everything resolved, just not sure in the way it resolved. But the more I think about it, the more I like it. Not a thing should be changed. 
 Also, I completely understand why Katniss did what she did, throughout the whole series. Any decisions she made, any actions she took, I understood her reasoning why, and almost always agreed with her. It's not easy to create a character in which readers truly understand, but Collins has done it here. She created a personality for Katniss that, while it did change based on what happened around her, the base of her character was always there. Splendid job in that regard. 
 Now, the epilogue. Maybe some people hate it, but honestly, I love it. It's so extremely powerful, and that last line? Yeah, that's a last sentence that I will always remember, word for word. It is the perfect way to end this series. Bravo, Suzanne Collins. Bravo.

 Well that escalated quickly! This one was my favorite of the series.... 
 Talk about a 180! The last book was boring and unimpressive, people were dying everywhere but I didn't give a fuck. This one, just the opposite. Almost all of my favorite characters die. It was sad, it was painful, it had emotion. Raw, real, guttural emotion. 
 I thought Suzanne Collins painted a pretty good picture of war. Particularly that there are no winners in war. We are introduced to district thirteen and immediately made uncomfortable by their militarized governing. There are so many rules here that it's almost worse than living in the districts. Though no one is left to die in the streets the way they were in district 12, there are very few real freedoms here. There's definitely subtle (or maybe not so subtle) stabs at both extreme conservative capitalism (in Panem there's no regulation and no gov't assistance, it's every man for himself) and extreme communism (in district 13 everyone eats exactly the number of calories they need, and everyone wears the same clothes and is provided identical living quarters). Suzanne Collins artfully shows how both extremes lead back to the same tyranny and oppression. We wanted so desperately to believe that district 13 was some kind of utopia of freedom, but in their attempt to be the exact opposite of the capitol and everything it stood for, they turned themselves into the capitol. 
 We are also introduced to another leader of the people, Coin. Katniss isn't sure what to make of her and neither are we. I wish she had delved a little more completely into the corruption of power, because by the time we meet Coin we are already a little leery of her and her motivations. As the book goes on we get to see more and more that Coin is not a friend to Katniss and by the end we don't believe that Coin is going to be any better than Snow as a leader of Panem. I cheered when Katniss took her down. 
 Katniss was suffering from a clear case of PTSD throughout this book, and considering all she went through up until this book (and then a shit-ton more during this book!) she deserved to be a little out of sorts. It made her even more real than the first two books could have. She was vulnerable and unsure and not the picture of the rebellion that district thirteen wanted her to be. In some ways I was disappointed that she didn't take over the capitol herself, but in others I am really glad that she didn't. I hated that her sister died, but it was the perfect catalyst to bring Katniss to question what she was a part of. If her sister hadn't died, she wouldn't have been lead down the path of discovering just who Coin was and what she was capable of doing. I like that Katniss was a complete mess after it all went down. Like I said before, there are no winners in war."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

 I thought Suzanne Collins painted a pretty good picture of war. Particularly that there are no winners in war. We are introduced to district thirteen and immediately made uncomfortable by their militarized governing. There are so many rules here that it's almost worse than living in the districts. Though no one is left to die in the streets the way they were in district 12, there are very few real freedoms here. There's definitely subtle (or maybe not so subtle) stabs at both extreme conservative capitalism (in Panem there's no regulation and no gov't assistance, it's every man for himself) and extreme communism (in district 13 everyone eats exactly the number of calories they need, and everyone wears the same clothes and is provided identical living quarters). Suzanne Collins artfully shows how both extremes lead back to the same tyranny and oppression. We wanted so desperately to believe that district 13 was some kind of utopia of freedom, but in their attempt to be the exact opposite of the capitol and everything it stood for, they turned themselves into the capitol. 
 We are also introduced to another leader of the people, Coin. Katniss isn't sure what to make of her and neither are we. I wish she had delved a little more completely into the corruption of power, because by the time we meet Coin we are already a little leery of her and her motivations. As the book goes on we get to see more and more that Coin is not a friend to Katniss and by the end we don't believe that Coin is going to be any better than Snow as a leader of Panem. I cheered when Katniss took her down. 
 Katniss was suffering from a clear case of PTSD throughout this book, and considering all she went through up until this book (and then a shit-ton more during this book!) she deserved to be a little out of sorts. It made her even more real than the first two books could have. She was vulnerable and unsure and not the picture of the rebellion that district thirteen wanted her to be. In some ways I was disappointed that she didn't take over the capitol herself, but in others I am really glad that she didn't. I hated that her sister died, but it was the perfect catalyst to bring Katniss to question what she was a part of. If her sister hadn't died, she wouldn't have been lead down the path of discovering just who Coin was and what she was capable of doing. I like that Katniss was a complete mess after it all went down. Like I said before, there are no winners in war." located at cell 'reviews'!E70.,

 OMG. Everyone loves Katniss and she has no idea why. I have no idea either.... 
 Okay, right off the bat I have to admit that the love triangle drove me absolutely crazy. Peeta or Gale? Who the fuck cares? BUT I can say that I thought there was care in how Suzanne Collins explained the Katniss love. I would have really rolled my eyes if Peeta had said "there's just something different about her." I thought it was much better to tell that his dad was in love with her mom and pointed Katniss out to Peeta when he was young. Also the dad showed Katniss special favor when she sold him her game. Okay, this makes it a more believable situation where she would catch Peeta's attention. The fact that her and Gale formed a bond naturally around hunting is passable too. But the whole best friend turned lover thing is tired and boring, but forgivable I guess. 
 NOW THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY... I do like the dystopian setting of this book. The way that the capitol keeps control of the country and the citizens through zero tolerance patriotism, and the yearly punishment of forcing children to fight to the death in an arena while the games are broadcast to the entire nation. Considering the premise I didn't think the book was quite as dark as I had expected. I am not sure what I expected, but I can see why this is still acceptable among YA readers. 
 I did take a little bit of issue with the arena ending. I read all three books before writing these reviews so I can see why they made the arena ending the way they did. BUT I also think that because they made such a big deal about people being drawn to the love story between Katniss and Peeta, that to take away their promise of two survivors and to force one of them to kill the other at the end of the games might have been enough to spark a rebellion anyway. 
 I had a love/hate relationship with Katniss as a character. I think in this book I mostly liked her. Though I thought she was immature at times I had to remind myself that she was only supposed to be 16 or 17 years old. I thought many elements of her character were overplayed stereotypes. The strong young girl who pays no attention to boys, and is temperamental and harsh but still manages to have two boys in love with her at the same time. Old and tired. Why can't she be those things MINUS the attention from boys. We don't need to teach our daughters that they are validated because someone loves them despite their being bitchy and off-putting. And she was kinda bitchy and off-putting. I suppose that isn't much different from a typical teenage girl in a lot of ways, but maybe if we rewarded our characters for kindness over aloofness we may influence our teens to be kinder and less aloof. Maybe not. But I digress... there were elements of her that were admirable. Her undying love and protection of her sister and her bond with Rue in the arena showed that she did have a softer, kinder side that she reserved for only a few. She had some character flaws and vulnerabilities which made her more realistic and likeable. I was drawn into her story and wanted to read on to the rest of the series to find out what happens with her."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man". But I recently came across Junot Diaz's reading list for his writing class and noticed "The Hunger Games" there. It sparked curiosity and an assumption that if the plot was cheesy, at least this story would be a good model for writing. Indeed, it is an excellent model. The story is well-paced, compelling, and full of content. At first I thought that the themes of trust and friendship would undergird all the action and page-turning suspense. Yet I was pleased to see the critical commentary on modern society that Collin's hit on, especially the disgusting effects of reality TV, namely the sick level of exploitation in entertainment and the lack of empathy from those who control and profit from the system. Also, I liked how, through Katniss, the author lays bare our sense of audience-- that the characters have no privacy and their lives are constantly broadcasted for public consumption. I think this is very relevant, especially for young readers, with the dominance of online social media. Nor does Collin's miss the opportunity to make subtle yet clear comments on classism and inequality between the Districts. The only criticism I have is that I did not really like the voice of the narrator. Katniss is not particularly endearing, but sharp and practical. The character even describes herself as coming across as "heartless." Perhaps-- as the traditional gender roles have been reversed-- this is part of her survival adaptation, and winning the games proves her tact correct. Overall, I was impressed with the layers of meaning in this YA novel and it's entertainment value, despite its already being a huge commercial success."  # Generated from value "I had avoided this one for a while-- a blockbuster dystopian YA novel that appeared to be a rehashing of Stephen King's "The Running Man".

 4.5 out of 5 stars 
 SPOILERS! But really I doubt you haven't read it yet! 
 So how can I review a book that's been read by everyone and made into movies love by everyone? LIKE THIS 
 This book takes place in a dystopian American society. The country now has a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer districts that only exist to produce goods for the capital. This novel centers around Katniss, a girl from the coal mining district 12. She's very poor and has to provide for her family in order for them to survive. Also In this society every year the Capitol has a competition called The Hunger Games. In these games, teenagers from all twelve districts are picked from a "reaping" and forced to fight to the death in these games. This is because before this society was created, the districts tried to rebel against the capitol and reach independence. When they failed, the Hunger games were created as punishment. This year, Katniss' younger sister is chosen. Rather than watch her sister be killed, she volunteers to go to the games in her place. 
 Now here's what I liked. Katniss. I LOVE Katniss. She's strong, she's practical, and she breaks down every single trope of YA heroines that you can think of. The book is in her POV. Part of the fun of the book is getting inside her head to see how she strategizes and how she reacts to the cruelty of the games. I also liked how district life felt almost historical, like it took place in the past. Then we get to the Capitol and it feels like science fiction. Then when we get to the actual games it feels like a survival story. The fact that all the sub-genres are seamlessly woven together is what makes this book so fun to read. It was fast paced and had wonderful side characters as well. 
 Now here are some things I, not disliked, but kind of expected more of because of all the hype. First, Rue's death was a little anti-climactic. I expected it to have more of an impact on Katniss than it did. Another thing was Peeta. I spent most of the book thinking that , like Katniss, he was faking the whole being in love thing. But him really being in love with her felt a little unnecessary. At least in this book. I felt it might've fit in later books. And there was one thing I really didn't understand. WTF WERE THE WOLF PEOPLE? Were they just designed to look like the dead tributes? Or were they the dead tributes made into wolf people? I don't understand. 
 So there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been already said. I really enjoyed the book, I had to read it for an English class. Still haven't seen the movie, will watch it today probably. And I hope everyone else has read it and enjoyed it as much as I did."  # Generated from value "The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins

         hasContent "** spoiler alert ** 
 I finished reading Twilight today. Took me about a day to read as it is such a quick read. I'm sure you've all read this. I put it off as long as possible. 
 I have a friend who had never read the Harry Potter series. She promised me she would read it if I read the Twilight series, so here I am. 
 I give it 3 out of 5 stars. Did I enjoy this? For a young reader, yes. I think it's more suited for high schoolers and younger. For adults? Meh. Here's my thoughts 
 It's a love story with a vampire. The beginning I thought was cute as it brought back the fun innocence of a crush (I've been married for a while now so this was fun to relive). Ex. The excitement of simply being in the same room or standing next to a person. I found that enduring. But once they had kissed, I saw red flags. Edward never let her make decisions. He always was telling her what was best for her, despite her protests... but she doesn't fight him too hard. You'd think after a while she'd get fed up. I would. Edward also couldn't keep his story straight. Ex. "I promise I'll be with you for forever. You'll never be alone. I love you." Then a few paragraphs later we get "It's not safe for you to be with me. We shouldn't be together." This happens continually throughout the book. His wishy-washy back and forth attitude was so reminiscent of high school dating. (Hence why I felt this was suited for a younger audience - you know this is the drama they crave). {I'm not denying I was like this. It's just obnoxious now} 
 Now Jacob. He wasn't in it too much. However, he actually asked and listened to what's Bella wanted. And he complimented her (Edward didn't always return compliments). And he made her relax. I also hated how he grew exponentially while she was away (she came back and he's 6'2"). I don't know of anyone who has a growth spurt that extreme. 
 I don't know which team I'm on yet as this first book doesn't really present you with an either-or conundrum. It was all about Bella and Edward. So I remain neutral. 
 Lastly, they left a loose end that bothered me. Bella calls her mom and leaves a voicemail frantically asking her to call before returning home. It turns out the bad guy intercepted it and responded. However, after he dies, mom shows up at the hospital to see Bella and never once mentions the voicemail. There's no way she wouldn't have called her moms cell phone. I know cell phones existed in this story because Bella used one to call her mom. And if she knew her mom wasn't home, why leave a message on a home message machine (plus - who even had those anymore?). So... mom should've clued in to the crazy that was going down in Phoenix. That bugged me. 
 Alright your Twilight fans. Do your worst. Tear me apart."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

         hasContent "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere. Girl meets boy. Boy barely manages to avoid eating girl. Boy and girl fall in love with each other. Boy stalks girl. Girl's okay with that. Boy probably won't kill girl, but he's making no promises. It's got a lot I like in a book passionate, chaste love-triangle-free romance (for the most part, if you stick to the first book); fantasy with a new perspective; excitement; a lot of pages. It's also repetitive, problematic, badly written. I was pretty surprised to see that I for the first time I couldn't enjoy it as much as before. Largely because for the first time, I read Edward as having no redeeming qualities. 
 Edward Cullen is cold. I'm not talking about his stone lips. I never realized before how mean and uncaring he is. Anytime Bella is uncomfortable or unhappy, he's laughing at her. Intellectually, I knew that the Edward/Bella relationship is abusive and controlling. But I didn't realize how much Edward uses that awful put-the-girl-down-to-make-her-like-you technique. Ugh. Edward Cullen is definitely not what Twilight has going for it. 
 Here's where Twilight's strengths are: The romantic/sexual tension in this book is largely very good. While I didn't find the meadow scene particularly compelling this go around, the build up to the first kiss is excellent. 
 The book really feels like two different books. The first chapter through the baseball scene, plus the epilogue feel like one book, while the prologue and baseball scene to the last chapter has a totally different tone. While somewhat suspenseful, the first portion is a meandering romance, while the latter portion feels like a somewhat dull thriller. 
 Overall, I wouldn't stop recommending this to fans of romance who can handle cheese. Although a handout identifying warning signs of abusive relationships nearby on the shelf wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm sure it's not my last reread, either. 
 Why people turn on Twilight: 
 -embarrassment because/ feeling of betrayal that they had liked Edward 
 -Breaking Dawn There are so many things embarrassingly much worse about that book compared to the rest of the series. It breaks all the rules of the world that have been set up previously. Everything about Renesmee from her name to existence is ridiculous. And things with Jacob get very squicky. 
 -because it inspires feverous praise, and then later people are embarrassed they praised it so much when they realize how flawed its writing/romance is 
 -because it's just plain kind of embarrassingly cheesy"  # Generated from value "I have tried for years to shake my affection for Twilight. Self-sacrificing girl moves to the middle of nowhere.

As hard as it may be to fathom this, I didn't know anything about the novel other than its Great Depression, Deep South setting. It is certainly eye opening today to hear the liberal use of racial epithets (the N word most notably) although it is certainly in keeping with the times and the location. 
 As much as I am fighting against it, I am a literary philistine when it comes to classic fiction. I spend most of my leisure reading time on non-fiction of all types so my reviews and ratings are often filtered through that lens. I very much enjoyed this novel, speaking as it does to the vile force that was and is racism in this country. Atticus Finch is certainly a worthy hero and I can see why this book is often taught in schools, despite the racism that is front and center. Atticus' attitude and belief system is admirable and his integrity shines through the whole narrative. His is certainly an attitude to life worth emulating. 
 The plot is not complex, taking place over three years but the racial themes, the loss of innocence, the lack of real justice and the humanity that runs through the narrator's father certainly make it pretty gripping reading. I am glad I read it and feel better informed, in my own small way, on a subject that is viscerally important to my liberal, bleeding heart!"  # Generated from value "I really should become more acquainted with the classic works of fiction and this is one, albeit from the 60s rather than the 19th Century, but still.

Atticus Finch is certainly a worthy hero and I can see why this book is often taught in schools, despite the racism that is front and center. Atticus' attitude and belief system is admirable and his integrity shines through the whole narrative. His is certainly an attitude to life worth emulating. 
 The plot is not complex, taking place over three years but the racial themes, the loss of innocence, the lack of real justice and the humanity that runs through the narrator's father certainly make it pretty gripping reading. I am glad I read it and feel better informed, in my own small way, on a subject that is viscerally important to my liberal, bleeding heart!" located at cell 'reviews'!E24.,

         hasContent "** spoiler alert ** 
 Angels & Demons... 
 This Dan Brown should be proud of himself...really. 
 This book and Da Vinci Code got me thinking...who the hell Dan Brown is. What is his academic background? I guess if the Illuminati ever came back to life and intended the wipe out Catholicism, they would drain their brains as they might but they wouldn't be able to come up with a plot as perfect and devilish as that of Dan Brown. This guy knows more than professors of history, physicists and religion men do; or at least he is a damn good researcher with an exceptional knowledge of rare fields like symbology and cryptography and a deep understanding of art, history and religions. It takes a smart professor of symbology to solve the riddles in the novel, but it takes a genius writer to create these riddles in the first place. Dan Brown is a genius. He really is. The air of mystery and apprehension in the novel is masterfully crafted that it engrossed me even when I off the book. I have to admit, I suspected all the characters. I suspected ALL of them except Langdon and Vittoria. I had to keep a computer close by so that every now and then I'd check google and youtube on scientific terms and historical facts. For me, this novel was not just a book; it was a whole experience. 
 Five stars...Yes. I fully enjoyed it... it is fairly long but you wouldn't wish it to end. My impression is mainly positive except for two points. The work as a whole deserves 5 stars nonetheless. 
 What I have to comment on rather than criticism is (spoilers coming ahead) 1) the Hassassin; the stereotypical sex-crazy terrorist barbaric Muslim Arab! Being a Muslim Arab, I felt offended. Plus... Come one Dan Brown, I guess you know better. The Hassassins, though considered a Shittii sect, were not at all religious. So I doubt that their descendants would in any way hold grudges against the church for sending the Crusaders centuries ago. And the few Arabic words the guy used - just to sound Arab - are of the Egyptian Dialect, while the Hassassins descendants, if any, would never be Egyptians. This might sound trivial (and this is why I didn't let this point affect my review) but the second point... I guess the director of the film version of the book would agree with me ... has to do with logic of events. Spinning over 128 chapters, the story was about a plot masterminded and carried out by a secret society; the Illuminati are many; they infiltrate organizations and hence, they are capable of carrying out an attack with the scale of that described in the novel; they can infiltrate the CERN, the Vatican; church, archives; monuments and all, the can infiltrate the Swiss Guard and the Vatican Police. This I understand. But reaching the end (folded in ONLY 9 chapters out of 137), it turned out that the whole plot was the work of a single guy! He is powerful; but he is one still. He imagined the full scenario and he had motives (a little bit overrated - but I think the author is implying that he was psychologically troubled). But when I tried to reconstruct the story from the new view point (that the camerlengo was the one behind the whole thing because he believed that the popessssss are not truly faithful to God), I had many questions that I couldn't find answers to; How did he recruit the Hassassin? Really? He did the whole thing in less then a month. How did he get that illuminati Muslim Arab Hassassin and convinced him to carry this out in revenge for his ancestors? In the film, the assassin did it for money, which was logical. But in the novel? It was all out of faith and loyalty. 2) How did he infiltrate the the CERN? Money? Maybe ..it just needed to be made clear. Guess to my humble mind, this is a very difficult fortress to break into. And finally, when the Hassassin called in the camerlengo's office, did he not recognize the guy's voice, since their relationship was only telephonic? Should I comment on Langdon's surviving a 3 mile fall from the helicopter? No, I won't. I still enjoyed the book greatly and still recommend it to everyone."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

The struggle to form an identity, and how the faction she rejections continued to define her...and how living in the space between factions was seen as dangerous resonated with my religious journey. The only real downside for me was the villians. I felt that the motivations of enemy faction were rather plastic and cartoonish.

         hasContent "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read. My thoughts after reading this? I am still not sure... 
 Overall this book was an entertaining exciting read where if you ignore the fictional world and its gaps, it was pretty good for about 3/4 of it. At first I was concerned since the first 80 pages or so reminded me of a retelling of The Giver. I found too many similarities in the plot that bothered me but eventually I overlooked that and enjoyed the quick fun read. 
 I have to admit I found Tris really dumb at times and would roll my eyes at parts so I am not too attached to her as a main character. 
 Reading along, I was hoping that this would be one of the first dystopian novels I would love - but then like all the other novels similar to this - the plot gets weird and force-fed to the reader. We happily follow a solid plot then it twists to something messed up AND just as we learn characters, the author kills them off. 
 I am still confused on how I feel about this book as I really enjoyed majority of it BUT I hope this isnt a series that gets even more messed up that completely derails."  # Generated from value "Divergent - An ever-popular dystopian book that sat on my to-read list until a friend mentioned it as a must read.

You've got the girl that ends up being a bad ass "chosen-one," you got a teenage forbidden romance, you've got the classic bad guy, a little loyalty, a little betrayal, and a lot of action. The premise seemed a little manufactured. Perhaps it would be appropriate to call the author of this book "Dr. Frankenstein" as she seems to create a story from plots found in the dystopian futuristic graveyard. Oddly enough, despite the cookie cutter premise, I really enjoyed reading this book. It it's the ground running and drags you along whether you want to or not.

         hasContent "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency. 
 The book is turned out to be so effective. Whether it's the sympathy driven success since a young girl who seems to be very refine writer got snatched the right to flourish naturally. Or it is real good write up. 
 I liked it because my rational mind accepts it rather than the emotional part would be swayed away by the ordeal of the girl. 
 At the age of 13 she is reading mythology and studying different languages. Reading was such a heavy part of her life, and not some ordinary reading (language, philosophy etc). The way she endured pain during hiding, thought critically and drew opinions based on her knowledge, reviewing books in a context that was related to her ordeal/life is something I held on to very dearly while reading. She had a clear idea what she wanted to do once they finish the hiding (spending time in Germany and London to get education on history of arts, languages). Some of the ideas like, 'the old people supposed to be less confused since they dealt with the hard part already and have pretty much worked out their ways than the younger evolving youth' and 'when you are upset, instead of holding on to the people who are miserable since their misery can make you realize the blessings in your life, one should rely on the happiness and colours around' are quite fascinating. She use to go back to the old entries in diary and see her complaining self which she found as "ungrateful". 
 The end makes me wonder how terrified she must had felt when they were caught and above all how desperate she had been to leave her dear kitty behind. How she had lived the next 6-7 months without writing. Her intellectual self-had the need to shed itself. How she had kept insanity without talking to Kitty, since that was one major thing which kept her going. 
 Anyhow, in the end, Kitty did do justice by bringing Anne Frank to the world. Otherwise we would have never known the intelligent girl like many others who must had been lost in evil-selfish human warmongering conquests."  # Generated from value "What an extra ordinary lovely young girl and such a pity to fall victim to human indecency.

 Anne Frank achieved a lot. She sent a message to the World, a message that, if only half the people listened to, would make this a better place. Oh--but she could have achieved so much more.

 UGH. This one was the worst... 
 I honestly don't know why this book is so highly rated. This one was definitely the worst of the three. It was a complete repeat of book one. I liked the beginning where she was starting to get little hints and glimpses that there was a rebellion starting in some of the districts. That part was exciting and I wanted to watch more of that unfold, but before I knew it we were back in the God damned arena. And then it was exactly like the first book, people dying all over the place, alliances being formed, and knowing all along that she's going to figure some way out of there for her and Peeta. She kept rambling on about sacrificing herself for Peeta and her martyrdom was SO.FUCKING.ANNOYING. We all knew she and Peeta weren't going to die. There was so much "action" in this one that I didn't even get a chance to care about anyone else in the arena with her. So as people were dying, even ones in her alliance, I did not find myself caring all that much. Maybe I had resigned myself to the belief that they might all die (except Katniss and Peeta) so I didn't allow myself to get attached to any of them. 
 So my advice would be to skip a whole bunch of chapters until they figure out how to blow up the arena and then pick it back up there. Then it gets more interesting again. But I felt left out of the uprising, left out of the "Catching Fire" that was the title of the book. We see little glimpses and then by the time they get rescued it's all out war. We don't get to see how the action in the arena has influenced the people of the districts and the rebellion. So I thought it was a lot of lazy writing. A lot of missed opportunities by going back into the arena. It could have been so much better if Katniss and Peeta had been mentors to the games, and we could have been involved in the rebellion alliance and then we could have been a part of the arena AND been better positioned to get information of the districts' uprising. She could have formed many of the same bonds with the other past tributes by way of her tribute forming alliances with theirs. But I guess it's no good to dwell on all the ways you could have written a better sequel. Anywho I don't have a lot else to say about this one."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **

Perhaps so, because Katniss is so cool, with her proto-Artemis/Diana quiver and arrows, and her disdain for leg-shaving and desire to just live alone. I love too that defiance in the world of the hunger games is kindness and solidarity rather than blind self-interest and individualism. The whole series is a demented reversal of Gil Scot Heron's "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" in which the whole revolution is played out in hyperreality and simulacra, and not only the revolution, but the counter revolution will in fact be televised.

         hasContent "Man, I totally did not appreciate this series as much as I should have the first time I read it. This story that Collins has created, one about oppression and government control, rebellion and fighting for freedom, is so well done. There is never a dull moment. Everything that happens is happening for a reason, and the pacing is just perfect. 
 I know many people are upset that Katniss lost her "badassery-ness" from the first book, but really, this just made me connect with and understand her even more. What she went through in the first Games, and all the terrible stuff afterwards, is horrifying. Of course it's going to affect her. So many characters nowadays don't seem to feel anything - they just push away all the bad thoughts and keep fighting. They're kinda like Gale, in a way. Running on rage and not really taking in and dealing with all the bad. 
 Katniss isn't like that. What she went through, what she experienced, it affected her. It changed her. And that makes her character even more realistic. Friends were killed, she had to kill, she had to see the repercussions of her actions - these types of things affect you in ways you cannot imagine. She will never be just another girl from District 12. How could she be, after all she went through? 
 Collins has created a dynamic, complex cast of characters, and she is not afraid to kill them off. They are at war, after all. Death is to be expected. The only thing I'm not sure about is the last couple of chapters (not the epilogue). I like how everything resolved, just not sure in the way it resolved. But the more I think about it, the more I like it. Not a thing should be changed. 
 Also, I completely understand why Katniss did what she did, throughout the whole series. Any decisions she made, any actions she took, I understood her reasoning why, and almost always agreed with her. It's not easy to create a character in which readers truly understand, but Collins has done it here. She created a personality for Katniss that, while it did change based on what happened around her, the base of her character was always there. Splendid job in that regard. 
 Now, the epilogue. Maybe some people hate it, but honestly, I love it. It's so extremely powerful, and that last line? Yeah, that's a last sentence that I will always remember, word for word. It is the perfect way to end this series. Bravo, Suzanne Collins. Bravo.

 Well that escalated quickly! This one was my favorite of the series.... 
 Talk about a 180! The last book was boring and unimpressive, people were dying everywhere but I didn't give a fuck. This one, just the opposite. Almost all of my favorite characters die. It was sad, it was painful, it had emotion. Raw, real, guttural emotion. 
 I thought Suzanne Collins painted a pretty good picture of war. Particularly that there are no winners in war. We are introduced to district thirteen and immediately made uncomfortable by their militarized governing. There are so many rules here that it's almost worse than living in the districts. Though no one is left to die in the streets the way they were in district 12, there are very few real freedoms here. There's definitely subtle (or maybe not so subtle) stabs at both extreme conservative capitalism (in Panem there's no regulation and no gov't assistance, it's every man for himself) and extreme communism (in district 13 everyone eats exactly the number of calories they need, and everyone wears the same clothes and is provided identical living quarters). Suzanne Collins artfully shows how both extremes lead back to the same tyranny and oppression. We wanted so desperately to believe that district 13 was some kind of utopia of freedom, but in their attempt to be the exact opposite of the capitol and everything it stood for, they turned themselves into the capitol. 
 We are also introduced to another leader of the people, Coin. Katniss isn't sure what to make of her and neither are we. I wish she had delved a little more completely into the corruption of power, because by the time we meet Coin we are already a little leery of her and her motivations. As the book goes on we get to see more and more that Coin is not a friend to Katniss and by the end we don't believe that Coin is going to be any better than Snow as a leader of Panem. I cheered when Katniss took her down. 
 Katniss was suffering from a clear case of PTSD throughout this book, and considering all she went through up until this book (and then a shit-ton more during this book!) she deserved to be a little out of sorts. It made her even more real than the first two books could have. She was vulnerable and unsure and not the picture of the rebellion that district thirteen wanted her to be. In some ways I was disappointed that she didn't take over the capitol herself, but in others I am really glad that she didn't. I hated that her sister died, but it was the perfect catalyst to bring Katniss to question what she was a part of. If her sister hadn't died, she wouldn't have been lead down the path of discovering just who Coin was and what she was capable of doing. I like that Katniss was a complete mess after it all went down. Like I said before, there are no winners in war."  # Generated from value "** spoiler alert **
