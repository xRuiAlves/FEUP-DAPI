A man was arrested for violating a law that said no one could teach evolution at a state-funded school. Freedom of education, freedom of thought, and freedom of speech is the focus of the trial and subsequent play and movie. I reread it through a new lens, that of the NFL protests and presidential backlash. In my book, Scopes, Rosa Park, and Colin Kaepernick are all patriots.

{"book_id":"1420","rating":5,"review_text":"The more preparation one has before reading this play, the more pleasure will come of it. I was helped a great deal by how to read and understand Shakespeare. \n Example: The first line of the play is \"Who's there?\", which we learn is significant because so much of the play is about identity and false identity. \n Example: The first line of the play is spoken by a soldier on some ramparts. That the play begins and ends in a military setting, with soldiers speaking is also significant. \n So, just from the very first line with two words, big themes are introduced that help understand the play. And it just continues. If one gets a bit of help, they can notice the recurrence of these themes and appreciate it that much more..","date":"2016-01-01"}

She makes this collection's simplicity work when she grounds it in an image or metaphor that just rings out perfectly in your ears. \n By the time I finished this collection, I was left both tired from the sheer emotional weight but rejuvenated by its unapologetic ferocity.

Having just slogged my way through a pretty awful Pulitzer winner, my expectations for this Newbery winner were low. Possibly non-existent, really. \n But it was good. \n Really good, in fact. \n As I flew through the first fifty pages or so, all I could think was that the writing is absolutely beautiful. I felt transported to Ohio, to South Carolina, to New York. I was immersed in the time period. In the current events. In the political climate and Jacqueline's home life.

I have learned a lot about myself and the art I want to make through trials and discovering what makes the most sense to me: don't show yourself in your work. \n It took me so long to separate myself from my work with the idea of having to appear in it, what I have come to realize is that I can have the best of both worlds. The author hasn't discovered that a person can put themselves into their work without it being obvious. I will tell you the cold hard truth: no one really cares about the emotions of another person. Everyone is so caught up in their own lives that sometimes there is just no capacity to care for anyone but ourselves. I admire that Rupi mentioned that in the last part of the book (interlaced with all of the feminism speak... blah), but I think that this healing process for her could have been written completely differently and less from her CONTRADICTORY experiences. \n I want to commend the author on the beautiful language she used, but I want to condemn the way she used it. It all seemed too focused on the people who brought her down rather than making it something that anyone reading the book could relate to. The author seemed to single out these people in such a way that it didn't even become something I could whole heartedly relate to. She made all of the men in her life sound terrible, yet there are great men out there. It is so easy to tear down the male sex now a days that it just isn't even enjoyable to read. \n Her writing was beautiful, just make it something a little more engaging next time?

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":5,"review_text":"Find this and other Reviews at In Tori Lex \n This book is a beautiful reflection at how racist microaggressions that most minority's face mentally chip away at the people who experience them. It's documents the weight of excusing racists slights and ignoring views in attempts to just exist as human.The book navigates between short poems and powerful vignettes. One of the most memorable being the disconcerting feeling and shame that happens when your friend says something to you that is racist, and it markedly changes how you feel about that person, no matter how many times they explain it's a joke. \n \"...a friend once told you there exists the medical term- John Henryism- for people exposed to stresses stemming from racism. They achieve themselves to death trying to dodge the buildup of erasure.\" \n The resounding truth I read in these poems, and the sigh of relief I felt reading came because I try very hard to look past small acts of racism. But it felt great to read that it's not normal to play by rules that have addendum's just for you, and meekly never complain. Claudia Rankin explains the racism that Serena Williams has experienced and how it is often overlooked even as she completely dominates her sport. Yesterday a sport's commentator in reference to Venus Williams said \"You see Venus move in and put the gorilla effect on. Charging.\" This illustrates how black athletes often deal with racism, and cast it aside as apart of the game, but that cost paid is never acknowledged. \n \"because white men can't \n police their imagination \n black people are dying\" \n This poetry collection includes mixed media. It highlights pictures, art installations and even refers to YouTube videos. I enjoyed it because the inclusion of modern illustrations and references made it a contemporary reflection for us all. The book also describes situations, which are videos produced on her website. I won't review the videos but I found context for what was described with out them. I would recommend this book to everyone, as a solid way to begin to understand how it feels to exist as an other in our society.","date":"2016-11-25"}

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":4,"review_text":"Had no preconceptions or ideas about this novel going in, just knew I was never a fan of verse novels and decided to just take this for what it is--and I was pleasantly surprised. Though the book is told from the point of view of a child and written in a stream of consciousness approach of her memories and views of life. This book read easily in less than a day and you get this real perspective of how a child feels about all the major events she grows up around--from the sit-ins and marches for segregation, to the Ruby Bridges story, and the precarious position black people find themselves in fighting for their rights. You get firsthand memory of moving and finding family and themselves in New York and South Carolina though never really being settled into each--I truly appreciated her talking about how the way people from the North talk different from Southerners and how this becomes a badge of pride and shame both simultaneously for the Woodson children depending on their environment. I also liked the history lesson on New York with its beginning Dutch settlers and a former Negro slave and the first name of New Amsterdam, the New York scenes were some of my favorites as you meet a Spanish girl and all the food and sights of the wonderful concrete jungle that you will never find anywhere else...such a true portrait as Spanglish and city living that mold her as you watch her grow up. Within these worn and sparsely written but powerful pages you meet their newest little brother Roman, his troubles with lead paint, the tragic loss of their aunt and their grandfather and Jacqueline discovering her love and passion for writing. The book was poignant and touching-- and despite the format this book taught me something and was enjoyable, glad I spent the day with this one and will push this one into a young reader's hands as soon as I can.it is worth spending time with.","date":"2017-06-24"}

With examples by Valerie Worth, Robert Frost, S.C. Rigg and Walter Dean Myers to inspire him he reluctantly attempts writing poetry and is ultimately enthralled by a Walter Dean Myers poem with a rhythm and cadence he likes so much he writes a letter to him and invites him to his school. So Mr. Walter Dean Myers shows up and gives him the advice and confidence to write his most touching piece which was on a dog he lost that he really loved. His poem \"My Sky\" was sad and clearly written and in my opinion one of the most thought provoking in the entire novel. Within the entire book there are the thoughts and writings of a young boy and you get really great raw emotion and simplicity.

They're worth only as much as the imagination of the one who writes them\" \n I like to travel so on the hand I am inclined to disagree with him but in the deeper sense his statements are true.

I rate this book 3.5/5 stars.","date":"2016-12-30"}

Having just gotten out of a relationship, I approached Milk and Honey as the ideal reader for these sparse passages of love, pain and healing. Her prose is to the point and cutting in its approach to abuse, the push and pull of romantic relationships, and the restorative power of self-acceptance. Her experiences are specific but universal in their appeal to anyone who has ever had a broken heart. I found the book very moving and certain poems were exactly what I needed to hear.","date":"2017-08-19"}

{"book_id":"2547","rating":4,"review_text":"A poetic little handbook of life, short and sweet. There are some obvious truisms and meh sections, but overall it's some good inspiration towards a good life especially for the young and those not already tired of discussing ways of life. \n The sections on work, eating and drinking, laws, and freedom were pretty mediocre, i didn't take away much from them. \n These are a few obvious truths that somehow cheapen the feeling of insight, but at least they come with eloquence: \n \"And ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation. \n For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction. Therefore, let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion, that it may sing;\" \n I'll end with some of the poetic, sometimes even surprising insights. \n \"Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret? \n Love one another, but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. \n Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. \n But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor, Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears. Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; For love is sufficient unto love.\"","date":"2017-08-19"}

I find The Aeneid a disgraceful failure to simulate Homer's work. To use lots of characters of Homer's epic poems -Scylla and Charybdis, Polyphemus to mention a few-, to use the same topics (such as Aeneas visiting hell, as Odysseus did) is a fact I find a bit insulting.

{"book_id":"676","rating":4,"review_text":"OH MY GOODNESS. THIS WAS SO GOOD. \n I feel like I have to preface this review with every new poetry reader's disclaimer: I usually do not like nor read poetry. Pretty much all the poetry I've been exposed to has been pretentious, inaccessible and just flat out confusing. It leaves me exasperated rather than inspired. Billy Collins' poetry, however, has completely changed that. \n Collins' poetry is accessible and simple without being boring or plain. His language is eccentric and complex (seriously, some of his metaphors are so strangely wonderful). Even though you can totally understand the poems, you still have to work for them -- they're challenging, which I absolutely love. Also, his poems are so broad in scope. Some poems are about life and mortality, and others are about Mondays and cows. This man writes about everything and anything. \n Honestly, I am so so glad I've found poetry that speaks to me. J.K. Rowling says \"If you don't like to read, you haven't found the right book.\" The same thing goes for poems, really. If you're not sure where to start with poetry, try reading Billy Collins' poems. You will not regret it. \n Here are some of my favourites: \n Days \n Each one is a gift, no doubt, \n mysteriously placed in your waking hand \n or set upon your forehead \n moments before you open your eyes. \n Today begins cold and bright, \n the ground heavy with snow \n and the thick masonry of ice, \n the sun glinting off the turrets of clouds. \n Through the calm eye of the window \n everything is in its place \n but so precariously \n this day might be resting somehow \n on the one before it, \n all the days of the past stacked high \n like the impossible tower of dishes \n entertainers used to build on stage. \n No wonder you find yourself \n perched on the top of a tall ladder \n hoping to add one more. \n Just another Wednesday \n you whisper, \n then holding your breath, \n place this cup on yesterday's saucer \n without the slightest clink. \n ------------------------------------ \n Consolation \n How agreeable it is not to be touring Italy this summer, \n wandering her cities and ascending her torrid hilltowns. \n How much better to cruise these local, familiar streets, \n fully grasping the meaning of every roadsign and billboard \n and all the sudden hand gestures of my compatriots. \n There are no abbeys here, no crumbling frescoes or famous \n domes and there is no need to memorize a succession \n of kings or tour the dripping corners of a dungeon. \n No need to stand around a sarcophagus, see Napoleon's \n little bed on Elba, or view the bones of a saint under glass. \n How much better to command the simple precinct of home \n than be dwarfed by pillar, arch, and basilica. \n Why hide my head in phrase books and wrinkled maps? \n Why feed scenery into a hungry, one-eyes camera \n eager to eat the world one monument at a time? \n Instead of slouching in a cafe ignorant of the word for ice, \n I will head down to the coffee shop and the waitress \n known as Dot. I will slide into the flow of the morning \n paper, all language barriers down, \n rivers of idiom running freely, eggs over easy on the way. \n And after breakfast, I will not have to find someone \n willing to photograph me with my arm around the owner. \n I will not puzzle over the bill or record in a journal \n what I had to eat and how the sun came in the window. \n It is enough to climb back into the car \n as if it were the great car of English itself \n and sounding my loud vernacular horn, speed off \n down a road that will never lead to Rome, not even Bologna.","date":"2016-03-18"}

Tal vez no sientas muy fuerte y claro todo esto (como yo al inicio) pero te aseguro que lo vas a sentir. \n Este libro es popular en redes sociales donde hay muchxs adolescentes y eso es fantastico porque es mas que poemas populares que encuentras en tumblr, instagram o en webs indie/pretenciosas, son poemas con trasfondos relevantes; tematicas importantes de tonalidades feministas. Es genial que lxs jovenes se interesen por estos temas, que lean sobre ellos, que sepan que existen y que si les ha pasado, no estan solxs. \n Entiendo que puede no gustarle a algunxs por ser simple y parecer pretencioso, pero opino que esta bien escrito y eso es suficiente para darle una oportunidad... ?no? \n Sin nada mas que agregar, consideren leerlo porque es fresco y reconfortante, las ilustraciones son buenas y tiene una buena atmosfera.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"It is always incredibly difficult to rate and review someone's personal experiences, and how they share their stories. Especially when the poet is a WOC, and her experiences are ones that I cannot speak from or possibly understand. \n From the beginning, something felt familiar about the poetry and once I reached page 26, I understood why. \n \"(homage to warsan shire's inheritance)\" \n This is poetry that wants to be Shire's, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. I can see bits and pieces of inspiration, and even wholsesale ideas, but they're never as poignant as they were with Shire's skill. Metaphors are often clumsy, or otherwise broken down from another source and put back together strangely. \n It may be unfair to compare two poets, but it's difficult to separate them when it's obvious she was an inspiration to Kaur. \n Not only Shire, but Kaur's poetry resembles much of what I see on my tumblr dash. Specifically, these lines: \n \"i was music \n but you had your ears cut off\" \n There was once a meme going around making fun of exactly these kinds of text posts. It's not bad writing, but it - like the rest of the collection - is retread ground. I've read this all before, maybe not in the same way, but in similar ways. And there isn't enough emotion, or power, behind the words for a different effect. \n Some verses stood out among others, while others were cliches with a new spin on them. Overall, it's a pleasant read, while incredibly personal, and passes on some inspiring but trite messages.","date":"2017-05-24"}

I know that this kind of relationship exists, but it still hurts to confront it so head on. \n I loved the female empowerment in the last section of this book. Women are allowed to have this strong connection with themselves. They do not have to have a man to feel good about themselves. I'm not sure why this section hit me so much, but it did.

In writing them in, he is giving them an even greater form of immortality. \n I enjoyed the poem \"America.\" It's asking the citizens of America what the war is worth, but America is also asking things of him that he wouldn't be able to live up to. He questions his own writing in this as well. \n Ginsberg has a very musical beat to his poems that makes you have to keep reading.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"Milk and Honey \n is a book of poetry that is divided into four chapters; The healing, the loving, the breaking, and the healing. \n To be honest, I was hesitant to buy this book since I tried quickly browsing through it in the bookstore and the length/style of some of the poems reminded me of Lang Leav's--not that I dislike her and her poems, it's just that I was looking for poetry of a different depth and style. Nonetheless, I picked it up 'cause I was drawn in by its minimalist cover and dark aesthetic that made me think this will be different, and in a sense, darker. (In a good way, or rather, just not your usual flowery poetry) \n In a way, it was. Style-wise, yes, there are similarities since the book also had this one-liners that fills up an entire page. Although, what was notably different with this one though was that the tone and the emotions that filled each page one chapter to another was more raw. It had an ugliness and uncaring side to it that you'd think was meant to attack its audience rather than fill them with beautiful words. (I mean this as a compliment to the book). The lovely poems are just as lovely as you'd imagine, but it also had a lot of painful and gut-wrenching poems that made the overall experience of reading this book worthwhile. \n I had every intention of sharing my copy to some people who I think would appreciate this as well, although now I don't think I can 'cause I ended up writing quite a lot of personal insights and reflections for several poems. Haha, oh well. \n A few favorite lines: \n \"Emptying out of my mother's belly was my first act of disappearance. Learning to shrink for a family who likes their daughters invisible, was the second. The art of being empty is simple.\" \n \"The world gives you so much pain. And here you are making gold out of it.\"","date":"2017-05-01"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"Wow! Wow, wow, wow! I wish I'd read this when I was 18 years old, although I am so glad I read it now--at 27. This is a heartbreaking yet beautiful and joyful journey trying to wade through muck and mire of the world; of trying to figure out who you are, not what others tell you who are. Also learning and understanding that you don't need anyone to make you feel complete but you complete yourself--you are whole and loved because you are you. \n Truth is, I don't read a lot of poetry. I think I got too much of the heavy, flowery stuff of the 1600-1800s that I'm a bit put off by it but this is lovely and such a break from the structure of what I've learned poetry to be. milk and honey is raw and honest. Whether it was just a few lines or big paragraphs or words, everything spoke to me in different and particular ways. A lot of Kaur's words describe exactly how I didn't know how to put into words what I felt when I was a teenager. \n \"i had to leave \n i was tired of \n allowing you to \n make me feel \n anything less \n than whole\" \n If you've ever been hurt or made to feel less than whole, if you've felt as if you've had to hide yourself, or if you've ever been in a dark places, please read this.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"2.5/5 \n Ok. So, I'm not the greatest patron of poetry, but \"Milk and Honey\" was just easy to breeze through. This is the second indian poet whose work I've come across this month; watch Aranya Johar's impressive slam poetry entry at Tuning Fork, called \"A Brown Girl's Guide to Gender\" and tell me if it doesn't leave you with goosebumps when she calls bullshit on the rape culture in India. \n Rupi Kaur has a very unassuming writing style that is refreshingly simple and concise without being too simplistic. I expected a collection of random poems, but that's not the case here; it's split into four chapters: (1) the hurting (2) the loving \n (3) the breaking (4) the healing ... and tells a story with beginning and end, about the different relationships in life with autobiographical parts interwoven in it, littered with Kaur's doodles. The relationships are those between parent-child, relatives, lovers and the one you have with yourself; sometimes healthy, other times abusive and destructive and how they shape you into the person you are. But in the end it's actually a journey of empowerment and acceptance. \n I've noticed poets writing poems with their words carefully placed on the page, lots of gaps and negative space, you see? I don't know if I'm just blind to the nuances of poetry, but if you write something like this: \n It automatically gets converted to this in my head: \n That being said, after reading Rupi Kaur's biography & FAQ on her website, I was better able to appreciate her work; for instance she eloquently explains why it's important for her to use lowercase and almost no other special characters in her writing: \n although i can read and understand my mother tongue (punjabi) i do not have the skillset to write poetry in it. to write punjabi means to use gurmukhi script. and within this script there are no uppercase or lowercase letters. all letters are treated the same. i enjoy how simple that is. how symmetrical and how absolutely straightforward. i also feel there is a level of equality this visuality brings to the work. a visual representation of what i want to see more of within the world: equalness. \n and the only punctuation that exists within gurmukhi script is a period. which is represented through the following symbol: | \n so in order to preserve these small details of my mother language I include them within this language. no case distinction and only periods. a world within a world. which is what i am as an immigrant. as a diasporic punjabi sikh woman. it is less about breaking the rules of english (although that's pretty fun) but more about tying in my own history and heritage within my work. / source \n kaur is great, when she uses anecdotes: \n when my mother was pregnant \n with her second child i was four \n i pointed at her swollen belly confused at how \n my mother had gotten so big in such a little time \n my father scooped me in his tree trunk arms and \n said the closest thing to god on this earth \n is a woman's body it's where life comes from \n and to have a grown man tell me something \n so powerful at such a young age \n changed me to see the entire universe \n rested at my mother's feet \n Parts of it felt contrived and cliched, but there were some shorter pieces amongst them too that stood out to me: \n i've had sex she said \n but i don't know \n what making love \n feels like","date":"2017-06-02"}

{"book_id":"96259","rating":4,"review_text":"\"We have not touched the stars, \n nor are we forgiven, which brings us back \n to the hero's shoulders and a gentleness that comes, \n not from the absence of violence, but despite \n the abundance of it. The lawn drowned, the sky on fire, \n the gold light falling backward through the glass \n of every room. I'll give you my heart to make a place \n for it to happen, evidence of a love that transcends hunger.\" \n What an experience. I'm usually not one for poetry, at least not when it comes to pleasure reading. I was a Literature major, I've been through my fair share of poems, I know how the repetitive rhythm of Alexandrine verses can get stuck into your head so that even your thoughts follow the same cadence afterwards; I've explored the themes of love and death and desire in all their forms. But, for me, the pleasure of reading poetry always centred around the analysis that came after the reading. So, this was something else. \n I still feel this need, it's an instinct at this point, something drilled into my whole being. My first thought after I'd read a couple poems was: \"I need a lecture on Homoeroticism in Contemporary Poetry ASAP!\". Because I want to talk about this book, I want to write essays about this book and compare interpretations, I want to analyse this book until it's left bare and open and bleeding. \n You could even write novels just about the title: I love the juxtaposition and the ambiguity about the meaning of the word \"Crush\". How it can be something innocent and light but, as a verb, is also something that destroys and oppresses. We're used to seeing love and thinking of love as this beautiful thing, but it's also violent. It's lust and desire, something animal and primal that you can feel all over, something which can take over your body and your mind, and do some damage on the way. \n I love the structure of the poems, how it gives poetry character: it's raw, it's like a stream of consciousness at times. And, while the Foreword talked about panic, I think the poems are more about pain and desperation. The rhythm of some poems especially sounds like desperation, like he needs to get it all out of his chest before it's too late, before he looses it, before his chance slips away. \"Saying Your Names\" is a perfect example of that. \n There's also the recurring themes of fire and destruction, and seeing it all happen/making it all happen as if it couldn't go any other way. Like, the author always talks about \"you\", and sometimes it's the person he loves/loved/wants to love, but sometimes it's himself, so it feels like he places himself as a spectator of all these events, watching it happen while unable to act accordingly or change a thing. And there's also guilt and blame and longing and tiredness. So much longing and tiredness. There's that passage from Wishbone about how love/lust/relationships in general can destroy us, and the tiredness, the fatigue in his tone, the feeling like he's stuck on a loop with no escape possible, condemned to continue on forever: \n \"You keep saying \n I owe you, I owe... \n but you say the same thing \n every time. Let's not talk about it, let's just not talk. \n Not because I don't believe it, not because I want it any different, but I'm \n always saving and you're always owing and I'm tired of asking to settle \n the debt. Don't bother. You never mean it \n anyway, not really, and it only makes me that much more ashamed.\" \n And god, I love Wishbone so much, you know? \n \"I'm battling monsters, I'm pulling you out of the burning buildings \n and you say \n I'll give you anything \n but you never come through. \n Even when you're standing up \n you look like you're lying down, but will you let me kiss your neck, baby? \n Do I have to tie your arms down? Do I have to stick my tongue in your \n mouth like the hand of a thief, \n like a burglary, like it's just another petty theft? It makes me tired, \n Henry.\" \n There's probably a hundred things to say about this book, about these poems, and I've barely scratched the surface there (if I even managed to make a dent in it). \n I bought this book because I often come across some of his poems and they always leave me dumbstruck. I just have this really strong reaction to his poetry, which is nothing I've ever felt before, and I was continuously left speechless while reading. So, not at all \"as if the top of my head were taken off\". Sorry Emily, but I don't think it's quite the right reference for me.","date":"2016-06-17"}

{"book_id":"1715","rating":5,"review_text":"In lieu of a review I present an essay on the poem 'Iphis'. \n In recounting the tale of \"Iphis\" in the Metamorphoses, Ovid (666-797) paints a picture of lesbianism that is of interest both for its psychological acuity and continuing sociological relevance. First in order of presentation here is a literary analysis and synopsis of the tale of Iphis and Ianthe, and then come two first order arguments to the effect it is not logically determined whether or not without divine intervention, Iphis' and Ianthe's love story would meet a tragic end if Iphis were not discovered to be a woman by Ianthe. \n Ligdos of Cnossos, in Phaestos, was as thrilled by the prospect of raising a boy child with his wife Telethusa, a Cretan, as he was mortified by the financial constrains that precluded him from rejoicing in the possible birth of daughter. Like any thoughtful father he'd thought the matter through and knew he could only support a boy child, and if it were his misfortune to have a daughter he instructed Telethusa she was to \"kill her\" (Ovid 692).

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"Milk and Honey by Rupi Kaur is a collection of poems in four movements: hurting, loving, breaking and healing that was published in 2015 and became a New York Times number one best seller. I thought it was beautifully presented but did not deliver. \n I suppose this is a stream-of-consciousness, direct type poetry but it was very underwhelming. Many poems were reminiscent of motivational quotes you might find on a chalk-board outside a hipster coffee shop, like 'accept yourself as you were designed'. \n There was an utter absence of vocabulary, figurative language and form to the poems. If you were to run the lines together you would be left with a fairly basic statement such as 'removing all the hair off your body is okay if that's what you want to do just as much as keeping all the hair on your body is okay if that's what you want to do'. \n A vast range of issues were covered such as child-hood sexual abuse, connivance of men, love and sex, healing after break-ups and self-love. None of these issues were explored in emotional depth or from a novel perspective. Everything felt like it had received a social-media treatment where emotions are both exaggerated for show but reduced in complexity. \n One positive was the journal-style concept of hand-drawn pictures scattered among the writing. This was very visually effective and no doubt has added to its appeal for many. \n All in all this book felt juvenile and lacking the celebration of language intrinsic to poetry. However with majority positive reviews it must be bringing happiness to a lot of readers. I suppose it could be a good introduction to poetry for young people, may it be the beginning of a lifelong reading habit for many!","date":"2017-09-10"}

{"book_id":"27494","rating":5,"review_text":"I celebrated myself by reading such a wonderful collection of poems that contains the gist of Whitman's ideas and ideals. \n Whitman touched upon a lot of transcendental topics and themes. Scholars still debate whether he was a transcendentalist or not. come on, the collection is brimiing of Transcendentalism. Themes like individualism, nature, and connectivity are transendentalists to the core. \n Whitman called for ending of slavery and emancipation. He also wrote poems celebrating the emancipation of Europe from the the repressing monarchies. Whitman was greatly inspired by Enlightenment thinkers at that time. \n individualism and equality are recurred thems that are dominant through out the book. But the individual Whitman was calling for, is the one who reaches out to all his other fellow humans everywhere.All people and objects in nature are averaged( equal.) according to Whitman. each iota in nature hides a divine secret. \n metaphysically speaking, death is not the end. It is just the beginning of another beginning. Vain people should not pride themselves on being strong, rich, or influential; death is the ultimate equalizer. \n Some poems oozes sexual images both heterosexual and homosexual. Heterosexual ones seem bland and lackluster compared to the vivid and passionate homosexual ones which reflects Whitman's repressed homosexual identity. \n The style marked by a departure from traditional English style and that of the old continent, which resulted in the rebirth of a true and genuine America poetry. I am glad Whitman let go of the boring traditional style. The lines ran more fluid and smooth with out the imposed old limitations. The author was taking pains in created true American poetry and he succeeded in that. \n Later poems dealt with sickness, old age and the poor reception of the collection. Whitman became sick and lonely later in his life, not to mention that he was disappointed with love after he broke up with his boyfriend. \n I am no usually into poetry but I consider this one a refined experience.","date":"2017-09-05"}

{"book_id":"45974","rating":5,"review_text":"The four months it took me to read Fernando Pessoa's posthumously-published collection of thought fragments have been some of the most fraught and chrysalis-splitting days of my adult life. This book will forever be synonymous with transition and grief, exploration and longing. I could read only bits at a time, for Pessoa's struggle to understand the world and his place in it mirrored my own and my many gasps of recognition left me breathless. \n Of course, this is not a book to be read in an orderly fashion, within a time frame, for a singular purpose. It is meant to be read as it was written, in fragments, unending, one you can pick up at any time, turn to any page, read forwards and back and inside-out. It is a kaleidoscope of dreams and reflections, a rumination on what it means to be a writer, the terrible weight of being human. \n Of The Book of Disquiet writer Rabih Alameddine says, \"A book tells you quite a bit about its author; a great book tells you quite a bit about you. When I first encountered Disquiet, I felt like laundry -- the book dunked me in pristine water, then battered and wrung me and hung me out to dry in sunshine, rejuvenated. I was forced to examine the choices I'd made, the beliefs I'd held, the loves I'd forsaken and the gods I'd worshipped. Yes. This. \n Pessoa penned his musings from Lisbon over the course of many years, from WWI to his death in 1935. We are seeing a dark time in the life of a nation, in the life of a solitary man with few friends and family, working at a clerical job which offered little but time to ponder. The melancholic tone woven throughout reflects not only Europe between the wars but a particular 21st century angst, as well. How does one live in the world without being swallowed by it? I found myself longing for the type of solitude Pessoa experienced, those many decades before our lives were invaded by television and the world was cinched tight by the Internet and social media. Detaching from the world is now so very difficult. I'm romanticizing Pessoa's loneliness, to be sure, but what bliss, this silence. \n I kept a piece of paper tucked inside the book, marking the numbers and opening lines of Fragments that resonated with particular force. Thinking perhaps I'd list them here, in my review. By the end, however, the list had become unwieldy, the fragments too many. But here are a choice few . . . \n * Fragment 28: A breath of music or of a dream, of something that would make me almost feel, something that would make me not think. \n * Fragment 48: Solitude devastates me. Company oppresses me. \n * Fragment 63: I feel like I'm always on the verge of waking up. \n * Fragment 93: By thinking so much, I become echo and abyss. \n * Fragment 112: We never love anyone. What we love is the idea we have of someone. It's our own concept--our own selves--that we love. \n * Fragment 152: To write is to lose myself, yes, but everyone loses himself, because everything gets lost. I, however, lose myself without any joy--not like the river flowing into the sea for which it was secretly born, but like the puddle left on the beach by the high tide, its stranded water never returning to the ocean but merely sinking into the sand. \n * Fragment 193: I am, in large measure, the selfsame prose I write. I unroll myself in sentences and paragraphs, I punctuate myself. In my arranging and rearranging of images I'm like a child using newspaper to dress up as a king, and in the way I create rhythm with a series of word I'm like a lunatic adorning my hair with dried flowers that are still alive in my dreams. \n * Fragment 194: A terrible weariness fills the soul of my heart. I feel sad because of whom I never was, and I don't know with what kind of nostalgia I miss him. I fell, with every sunset, against my hopes and certainties. \n * Fragment 231: One of the soul's great tragedies is to execute a work and then realize, once it's finished, that it's not any good. \n * Fragment 258: To have touched the feet of Christ is no excuse for mistakes in punctuation. If a man writes well only when he's drunk, then I'll tell him: Get drunk. And if he says that it's bad for his liver, I'll answer: What's your liver? A dead thing that lives while you live, whereas the poems you write live without while. \n The Book of Disquiet is a particular meditation that were it published today, would come accompanied by trigger warnings for the depressed and anxious. But even in its elegiac angst, there is beauty and comfort to be found. A treasured read I will return to again and again as I struggle to make sense of my life and my place in the world, as Pessoa did nearly a century ago.","date":"2016-03-13"}

{"book_id":"18263725","rating":4,"review_text":"This book is incredible. \n I would absolutely say that to read this book you have to listen to it on audiobook. It's written in verse, so that makes the experience of it all the more powerful. It's rhythmic, melodic, prosaic and probably one of my favourite audiobooks ever. The author has such great little riffs and tricks that he can pull with his words, I didn't know a book could be so smooth, so effortless. \n If you like Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates, you'll love this book. \n I know nothing about basketball, but it actually doesn't matter because the story is great, and the characters are so well-developed for a young adult novel. It really surprised me. \n I feel like I swallowed this book whole. Maybe I'm officially out of my reading slump thanks to this book. \n Either way, I have a new favourite genre.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"I really liked this book. \n It could be compared to salt. by Nayyirah Waheed or Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth by Warsan Shire, however I feel like Kaur's writing is more personal and less political than either of those two. \n My favourite section was the first section, 'the hurting'. My favourite poem is on page 20. It stunned me and left me breathless. However, this section should come with trigger warnings for sexual violence, non-consensual sex, domestic violence -- BUT if you are at all sensitive to any of those things you can still read and enjoy this book, just skip onto the second section of the book called 'the loving'. \n I really enjoyed having a paperback copy of this book because I was able to really value and enjoy the beautiful spidery drawings that accompanied so many of the poems. They added such character and another really personal touch to Kaur's work. Her continuous use of 'you' to address the reader makes the reading experience all the more real and intimate. \n I was disappointed by some of Kaur's poems in 'the breaking'. While I know Kaur is a feminist and very much supports and loves women, the way some of the poems are written really... stunned me. Perhaps it was entirely unintentional but the jealousy of her poems made me feel like she was degrading to the women she was addressing in her poems. \n \"she doesn't kiss you like i do \n she doesn't lick you like i do\" \n Suddenly, within so few lines, the poem becomes not about Kaur's jealousy and pain of a break up, but about some other woman in a new relationship with a previous boyfriend. In the last section, Rupi Kaur praises women and how wonderful we all are in our femininity -- so I just don't know where poems like that even came from. \n Regardless, I'd recommend this collection. It's short, soft and heartfelt.","date":"2016-04-28"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"This book is hard to rate, so I'm going to list it up in hopes that makes my thoughts easier to sort. Ready? Lets go. \n 1: I am a little shocked at how young a few people were who recommended this to me. Rupi is only 23, so I thought maybe this was more YA friendly poetry, but NO. I was wrong. You can certainly tell the author is young, especially in some of her love and breakup poems, but the themes of sexuality and abuse are graphically detailed, and I probably wouldn't hand this to a 15 year old, and I DEFINITELY wouldn't hand it to the 13 year-old who told me at the book store that she's read this book three times. I am all for young people discovering and loving poetry, and I don't think authors pretending sex isn't real until someone is old enough to legally drink does anyone and favors, but age appropriateness is a thing, people! And it's a thing for a reason. \n 2: That being said, I'm a grown up, so yay. But this collection was so hot and cold for me. The poems I liked I LOVED, and the ones I didn't were very meh for me. At several points it just got angsty, and I felt old because I neither like nor particularly relate to angst these days. Things like... \n \"it must hurt to know \n i am your most \n beautiful \n regret\" \n and... \n \"more than anything \n i want to save you \n from myself\" \n Just no. I feel fairly certain nine thousand other young, brokenhearted souls have written those exact same lines. Whoever her editor was did her no favors by indulging some of these \"poems\" along side actually beautiful poetry. \n \"i am not a hotel i am home \n i am not the whisky you want \n i am the water you need \n don't come here with expectations \n and try to make vacation out of me\" \n Lines like this are so beautiful and moving, and I think the collection as a whole would have been better if it had been shorter, but only contained the pieces that really packed a punch. Like I said, the things I liked in this collection, I truly loved. Rupi has so many good things to say, about the way women bodies are treated like commodities, about body hair and learning to understand our parents and self-acceptance and surviving abuse. They just got a muddled in with the angst, and it brought everything down a peg. \n 3: The common theme in several of the break-up poems was basically, \"HA! You can be with someone else, but she'll never be as good as me. You'll never love someone else like you loved me. She's just a poor man's me, sucker!\"She literally says that the next woman \"will be a bootleg version of who i am.\" And I just don't respect that.I think it's easy to go to that place in pain after a breakup, but all that \"I'm strong because I'm a woman,\" stuff she also talks about includes the grace to realize that the woman after you is just as exquisite and worthy as you are. Don't cheapen who she is because you're not over her boyfriend yet. That's what children do. \n 4:Rupi definitely has talent, but some of her idiosyncrasies drove me nuts. No capital letters, always saying \"cause\" instead of \"because\", shoddy punctuation. Ugh. Just no. You are not ee cummings! I realize those things are just personal preference, but they bugged me none the less. \n So, those are all my thought, I think. 3 stars overall.","date":"2016-06-13"}

This is one of few times that I have been so grateful for the hype surrounding a book, because I may never have given this a chance otherwise. \n I devoured this book in one sitting... or standing, rather. I was down in the States for a camping trip and went into Walmart for groceries. I saw Milk and Honey in the book section, intending to only read a little bit and then perhaps continue on the next time I came in. Needless to say, I didn't need to come in another time to finish it. Within 20 minutes I was finished the book and left completely awed at the beauty hidden within the pages. I was completely shook.

{"book_id":"6656","rating":5,"review_text":"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate... \n The most wonderful thing about The Divine Comedy is that people seem to see what they most easily connect to within the sprawling beauty of antique verse. As Dante Aligheri travels through the spheres of Hell (Inferno), where he sees the suffering and torment of the damned, including Satan his infernal self, Purgatorio, where he ascends the mountain where moderate sinners are doomed to eternal toil, and finally Paradisio, where angels fly amongst the clouds and finally he finds his beloved Beatrice, readers have discovered social commentary, old-testament style religious rhetoric, political satire - doubtless influenced by Alighieri's exile over the feuding houses of Florence of the time - and, for the hopeless romantics like me, an epic and comprehensive allegory to the tormenting scars love leaves when it is ripped away. \n All might be accurate, indeed it is nearly impossible to understand some of the traveler's observations of key figures in the Florentine instability who pop up in the afterlife without knowledge of the political context, but it isn't really important. The saga begins deep in a forest, midway through life's journey. That could mean his exile, that could mean the abysmal outlook of a middle aged man stripped of profession and direction, or that could mean the blinding agony Aligheri found himself in when his young, already betrothed (he was married himself) muse Beatrice died of an illness at just 23. For me, his searching the after life to find and be forgiven by her is the greatest and most profoundly truthful allegory to make peace with unrequited and tragic love ever conceived. \n Essays enough to bury Mount Purgatory have been written, so there's little to add to the analyses which has been done over the centuries. As a translation, this particular volume is beautiful and ethereal, which suits the latter two books, particularly Paradisio. However, it was not the original intention of the author to be so beautiful. Inferno's original language was intentionally quite crass and peppered with coarse language (of the time) and should have been preserved for this otherwise fine edition. Too often the sequels to Inferno are forgotten, so alive and haunting is Dante's account of hell, but they are a perfect cure, as the heart convalesces from the grief of lost love, so Dante and Virgil ascend to the gates of heaven itself, and add context to what otherwise might have just been a mindless, if beautiful rendered, tale of suffering in the afterlife. \n For that, I am thankful that this bumper edition fell upon my desk.","date":"2017-01-12"}

I can see why the collection is doing well - Kaur's voice is authentic and deeply intense and the drawings accompanying the text are beautiful, bringing alive her words. \n That said, I found myself thinking more than once that so far so good but I hope she doesn't trigger off a trend of some kind.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"Thankfully I didn't pay good money to read this. Could not finish it. \n I've heard it said that if you can't say anything something nice then you should not say it at all. Well, I'm not going to say a lot nice about this collection (of what? Of words?). I don't want to suggest, though, that this is not bad poetry, I want to suggest it is not poetry. It honestly feels like unstructured thoughts with random line breaks to give it the appearance of poetry, when it isn't. There is not more to say as an overview - it feels like something I myself might have wrote as an undergraduate and thought profound in my pretentious naivety. \n That is not to say this is simply waste paper. Some entire poems are actually quite interesting, and would have made good lines in real poems. Like: \n ''i've had sex' she said, \n but i don't know \n what making love \n feels like' \n Which deserves to be a part of something more complex. The fact that all together there are 15 syllables in this poem means it could have been an interesting section, a line and a bit, of a larger blank verse narrative poem, like something out of 'Death of the Hired Man' by Robert Frost. It feels like it deserves better, but judging from the rest of the collection entire poems are made up of the occasional interesting observation like this - the poet knew she had something there, but did not expand or develop the thought into a poem, but instead put line breaks in and threw it into the manuscript. It's hard to lose the feeling that this was the writing process, another interesting observation is: \n 'she was music \n but he had his ears cut off' \n The obvious complaint about anatomy aside (you can actually hear things with your ears cut off, just not as well) there is something here that has some kind of merit. What she is getting at here is good, but the execution is completely lacking. \n Other pieces (I don't want to call them poems) are just trash: \n 'the idea that we are \n so capable of love \n but still choose \n to be toxic' \n This is just nonsense, overly simplistic at best. \n Another example: \n 'loneliness is a sign \n you are in desperate \n need of yourself' \n Again, this is at best overly simplistic, and there is nothing more to this piece - so it is a general statement made about the concept of loneliness. The point this is trying to make is that if you are comfortable and in tune with yourself you can never be lonely, but I can't say I think that is very true. Nietzsche's emotional isolation comes readily to mind as a counter-argument to this piece. \n I am using the word 'piece' instead of 'poem' partly as sarcasm, but few of these poems are titled - seemingly following some sort of Imagist modernist like William Carlos Williams or e.e. cummings (even refusing to use capital letters - I don't like e.e. cummings very much). When they are given titles they add nothing to the content. I know that is not a rule, and not necessary, I'm not saying it is, but if there is an attempt to be profound then the asinine titles just makes it harder to see this as anything other than the work of a poetic amateur who has not put much thought into her output. \n If we are to treat this book as a collection of poems, there is not (aside from line breaks) any use of poetic technique at all. And the use of line breaks seem arbitrary, neither keeping a consistent metric or playing with the structure of word sounds - like in William Carlos Williams poem 'The Red Wheelbarrow' for example. Between chaotic free verse and short prose essay-things, I could not find any attempt at variation of style and form. The free verse does reflect the chaotic, troubled theme of some of the poems, but I suspect this was not a deliberate reflection and instead the poet is using free verse because that's what she thinks is what makes it a poem. The utter lack of even attempting a clever use of poetic techniques again just screams that this was written by an amateur. Or worse, someone who does not care very much about poetry. \n To this book's credit, it does deal with some very troubled subjects, alcoholic parents, relationships, abuse, the differences between men and women, and as an emotional catharsis then I suppose others might find this book very comforting. But. Such subjects alone do not justify this book content-wise - as a collection of what are called poems. \n This can not even be classed as confessional poetry, like say Sylvia Plath or Robert Lowell, because there the emphasis was on the 'I', the personal which had something of the universal - and while that is here, it is not done in the same way. Here the focus was not on the experience, from which the universal might be found through investigation but the experience is still the subject, instead the focus is on on a vague attempt at profundity. Often in a simple, aphoristic way; it reads like very bad motivational posters. \n I said at the beginning of this review that I could not finish this book, and I don't think I'm missing out on anything by not finishing it. It's rare to find a book so blisteringly bad in almost every aspect.","date":"2017-01-05"}

{"book_id":"676","rating":5,"review_text":"The two-time poet laureate of the Untied States is perhaps on of the most readable poets today. He has a unique knack for taking the mundane and making it interesting. I have read several of his collections and have enjoyed them all. \n \"Bar Time\" is an interesting reflection. Clocks in bars are set fifteen minutes ahead of the current time to prevent violating the law of serving after hours. Collins take a different view of the time difference. He sees the bar as a time machine putting him fifteen minutes ahead of those people he sees walking outside. A window to the past and comfortably ahead of the cares and concerns of those outside. After a few drinks, one could easily form this story in their head. \n \"The History Teacher\" looks at the education of our children and the softening of history. The Ice Age is the Chilly Age, The Spanish inquisition is simple inquiries by the Spanish, The Enola Gay dropped an atom on Japan, and the Boer War becomes the Bore War of old stories. The fun Collins has with names of events can be seen as humorous or as the failure of the education system: \n The children leave his classroom \n for the playground to torment the weak \n and the smart \n mussing up their hair and breaking their glasses, \n \"Pinup\" is about a bored man sitting in a mechanics garage while his car is being worked on. His mind drifts to the calendar on the of a pinup girl and what she is doing and wearing. He becomes absorbed at looking a the picture and almost misses the mechanics call for him to come over. Once there the mechanic shows him that the problem is more expensive than originally thought. The man concludes that it can't be helped and returns to his seat and lifts the calendar to the next month and sees a new pinup girl and story. \n These above poems are from his selected works which make up most of the collection. The new poems are only a handful. This is unfortunate but like the man in the garage we can always go back and become absorbed in the previous poems again.","date":"2017-04-16"}

Such as the corruption of even the people of church or the stereotypes about women (mostly wives). I understand that Chaucer, the auther, not the narrator, criticizes these themes through his tales but depending on the reader his views could also reinforce certain views. \n I had started the book a couple of times after school and to be honest I went through some stories way too quickly, but probably one day I will go through them again.","date":"2016-09-15"}

Out of curiosity I picked this off the library shelf and I'm glad I did. It is a 3-disc audio recording of a radio play by BBC actors including John Hurt. It is much more than a simple audio narration. The acting is superb with many actors. Music and sound effects help give it a full dramatic impact. Screams of the condemned can be heard in the background. I had expected archaic, hard-to-follow language like Shakespeare in the original form, but this was in contemporary English. Other than a few references to specific popes and other religious and political leaders, it could be mistaken for a work written today. Dante writes with a biting satirical lance colored by the clear religious fervor of the devout Catholic of his day and place. Everyone is skewered - the bankers and politicians, the greedy and the envious, the lustful and the lazy, even the good well-meaning rulers who do not use their power to better the lives of others. \n Dante is the main character in his own story.

{"book_id":"2547","rating":2,"review_text":"The Prophet is a short faux-bible, easy to read with no messy god references to afflict the spiritual agnostic who doesn't like reading books.

First, some person from the audience, with an innocuous stated occupation, bids the Prophet speak on any culturally important subject other than injustice or challenging established power. Then the Prophet strokes his beard, looks a little like Jesus in the reader's mind because of the cover drawing, and answers, \"because your question is surprisingly safe, I will tell you...\" It almost gets as silly as \"Then the dental hygienist said, 'Tell us about buying wholesale!'\" Or \"Then the Caddy at the Miniature Golf Course said, \"Tell me, how do I get wine stains out of my slacks?\" The content of this book is so light, I posit this: Divide any hippie/new age group into three smaller groups: Group One must only follow their own conscience (a la Rufus Jones) and not society for two weeks. Group Two must follow only the advice from the poem Desiderata, which you can read in five-minutes tops, for two weeks. Group Three must follow only what is learned from reading the Prophet for two weeks. I can't imagine the Prophet group will ranking themselves significantly higher at anything, compared to the Follow Your Conscience or Desiderata groups after the two weeks. And this book has a lot of unhelpful comments like, \"Much of your pain is self-chosen\" and ponderous 'trust me I'm deep' crap in it like: \"Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent.\" Or \"For when you strive for gain, you are but a root that clings to the earth and sucks at her breast.\" Or \"If these be vague words, then seek not to clear them.\" - Sounds like a predator 'gaslighting' his victim. This book also tries to sound hip by constantly contradicting itself to sound deep: You must be orange to be blue, you can't be purple without being green, to work is to relax, you can only hate what you love (actual quotes: \"what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows?\" and \"He is for your growth, so is he for your pruning.\" and \"the hunter was also the hunted\"). I've seen this book for decades next to \"Be Here Now\" on almost every New Ager's coffee and always wondered what deep spiritual truths lay inside. This book has sold so many copies yet offers so little to its reader, it should instead be called \"The Profit\".

That's when I got the ebook myself and started reading it. \n milk and honey is divided in four parts (\"chapters\"): the hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing. \n Personally, I could emotionally relate to the hurting and the healing the most, and that's where I also found some of the most powerful poems. \n it is your blood \n in my veins \n tell me how i'm \n supposed to forget \n Particularly I feel this one deep in my bones: \n you were so afraid \n of my voice \n i decided to be \n afraid of it too \n A couple more from the last part: \n do not look for healing \n at the feet of those \n who broke you \n And this one: \n what terrifies me most is how we \n foam at the mouth with envy \n when others succeed \n but sigh in relief \n when they are failing \n our struggle to \n celebrate each other is \n what's proven most difficult \n in being human \n I could still see the value of the remaining two parts, but I also thought some of the poems in them were a bit...not really poems? What I'm trying to say is that some were just called \"poems\" because \n the author decided \n to press enter \n but they just \n felt like plain common sense to me. \n While I still agreed 100% on the things said in them, I also felt slightly uncomfortable at the format of some of them. Regardless, there are real pearls here as well: \n if \n he can't help but \n degrade other women \n when they're not looking \n if toxicity is central \n to his language \n he could hold you \n in his lap and be soft \n honey \n that man could feed you sugar and \n douse you in rose water \n but that still could not \n make him sweet \n In any case, this is a great and quick read for everyone (it doesn't matter if you usually don't read poetry), and its messages are so important. \n _________ \n i'm so bad at \n rating poetry \n this is hard \n someone help me \n - a full review will come","date":"2017-01-02"}

{"book_id":"19351","rating":5,"review_text":"May I introduce to you? The Epic of Gilgamesh. It is the oldest surviving work of literature in the world. The clay tables themselves are 400 years older than the Odyssey, but the story itself dates back to somewhere between 3000 and 4000 BC. Unfortunately some parts are missing, but you still get the story and it's very very enjoyable. \n This is the version I read: http://www.amazon.de/Das-Gilgamesch-E... \n The Epos is about King Gilgamesh - who is half man and half god- worrying about the exact same things we do nowadays. Finding a purpose in life, making good friends (that bromance though!) and dealing with death. My favorite thing about the whole thing definitely was the role sex played in the epos. Actually, quite a big one (shocker!): two of the biggest twists had something to do with sex. Well, one with the denial of it and the other one made a savage man into a civilized one. (I completely adored that part.. I mean, isn't the church teaching you the exact opposite? That sex is a sin and brings out the animal in you? Well, the ancient sumerians knew better ) \n I wanted to read the epos since I was a teenager because my former german Professor kept talking on and on about it and was the smartest person I ever met.

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":3,"review_text":"This isn't a review but an observation, bearing on my project Writing with Images -- I am studying the history of fiction and other narratives with images. Given the fact that Rankine's interest is life as an African-American woman, and the racism with all the ordinary, sometimes daily insults, condescension, unthought disrespect, half-noticed slurs, and other painful experiences, it does not often make sense that most of her illustrations are by successful artists. There is very little reference to the artists in the text, which I think has to lead to the conclusion that she thinks their work is the best illustration of her concerns. But is it? Carrie Mae Weems, Nick Cave, or Glenn Ligon often have very different agendas and interests, and their work raises specific issues that are not mentioned in the text -- and the reason for their absence is itself not articulated \n For me, the only way to read the illustrations in \"Citizen\" as apposite to the text is to think of them generically, as art, and not to notice, or to forget, their different careers, symbolism, and narratives. A few pictures are from the media, like the one of Caroline Wozniacki pretending to be Serena Williams (p. 36), or Hennessy Youngman (p. 23). Those fit the narrative perfectly. \n I wonder if a more careful selection of images, and more passages in the text meditating on the images and their meanings, might not have raised the stakes for the narrative itself, by adding a level of reflection about what visual materials best give voice to the texts' concerns.","date":"2016-02-28"}

{"book_id":"18003300","rating":2,"review_text":"I always find charm in poems that labor of complex words and confusing logic, that make me think and wonder and reflect upon their meaning for days (often without success); I want poems that consume my entire being and engage me to find colors and figures and emotions among the words. I want poetry that takes me somewhere and lets me get lost to the magic of it all. \n Sadly, I wasn't all fired up with Love & Misadventure. Lang Leav is clearly an advocate of poetry rhymes, but I have left it eons ago, which is why I sort of cringe and feel like a grade schooler whenever I read her repeating rhymes about love and heartaches and misfortune. Her poetry has been described as something that expresses \"complexity beneath its childlike facade\", but I only see the rudimentary style and not the supposedly striking balance between intricacy and plainness. Perhaps if I was still a thirteen-year-old girl gushing over a boy for the first time, or a sad fifteen year old dealing with an unrequited love, her poems would have left a lasting impression. I only think her style has grown into me as I read along because I found the last few of her poems a bit more tolerable for me to take in. But to be fair, I did like some of the short notes (essays) that deal with unhappiness and heartache, and it was a positive thing that she suddenly stirred up my interest in poetry and made me reread some of my favorites by Angela Manalang-Gloria, Anne Sexton, Louise Gluck and Pablo Neruda. \n I heard Lang Leav is releasing her latest book of poetry. Hopefully, the new book will show more promise.","date":"2016-09-01"}

And down we went. \n In the mountains, there you feel free. \n I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter. \n What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow \n Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man, \n You cannot say, or guess, for you know only \n A heap of broken images, where the sun beats, \n And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, \n And the dry stone no sound of water. Only \n There is shadow under this red rock, \n (Come in under the shadow of this red rock), \n And I will show you something different from either \n Your shadow at morning striding behind you \n Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you; \n I will show you fear in a handful of dust. \n Frisch weht der Wind \n Der Heimat zu \n Mein Irisch Kind, \n Wo weilest du? \n \"You gave me hyacinths first a year ago; \n \"They called me the hyacinth girl.\" \n --Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, \n Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not \n Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither \n Living nor dead, and I knew nothing, \n Looking into the heart of light, the silence. \n Oed' und leer das Meer. \n Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante, \n Had a bad cold, nevertheless \n Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe, \n With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she, \n Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor, \n (Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!) \n Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks, \n The lady of situations. \n Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel, \n And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card, \n Which is blank, is something he carries on his back, \n Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find \n The Hanged Man. Fear death by water. \n I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring. \n Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone, \n Tell her I bring the horoscope myself: \n One must be so careful these days. \n Unreal City, \n Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, \n A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, \n I had not thought death had undone so many. \n Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, \n And each man fixed his eyes before his feet. \n Flowed up the hill and down King William Street, \n To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours \n With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine. \n There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: \"Stetson! \n \"You who were with me in the ships at Mylae! \n \"That corpse you planted last year in your garden, \n \"Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? \n \"Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? \n \"Oh keep the Dog far hence, that's friend to men, \n \"Or with his nails he'll dig it up again! \n \"You! hypocrite lecteur!--mon semblable,--mon frere!\" \n II. A Game of Chess \n The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne, \n Glowed on the marble, where the glass \n Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines \n From which a golden Cupidon peeped out \n (Another hid his eyes behind his wing) \n Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra \n Reflecting light upon the table as \n The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it, \n From satin cases poured in rich profusion; \n In vials of ivory and coloured glass \n Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes, \n Unguent, powdered, or liquid--troubled, confused \n And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air \n That freshened from the window, these ascended \n In fattening the prolonged candle-flames, \n Flung their smoke into the laquearia, \n Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling. \n Huge sea-wood fed with copper \n Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone, \n In which sad light a carved dolphin swam. \n Above the antique mantel was displayed \n As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene \n The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king \n So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale \n Filled all the desert with inviolable voice \n And still she cried, and still the world pursues, \n \"Jug Jug\" to dirty ears. \n And other withered stumps of time \n Were told upon the walls; staring forms \n Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed. \n Footsteps shuffled on the stair. \n Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair \n Spread out in fiery points \n Glowed into words, then would be savagely still. \n \"My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me. \n \"Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak. \n \"What are you thinking of? What thinking? What? \n \"I never know what you are thinking. Think.\" \n I think we are in rats' alley \n Where the dead men lost their bones. \n \"What is that noise?\" \n The wind under the door. \n \"What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?\" \n Nothing again nothing. \n \"Do \n \"You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember \n \"Nothing?\" \n I remember \n Those are pearls that were his eyes. \n \"Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?\" \n But \n O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag-- \n It's so elegant \n So intelligent \n \"What shall I do now? What shall I do?\" \n \"I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street \n \"With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow? \n \"What shall we ever do?\" \n The hot water at ten. \n And if it rains, a closed car at four. \n And we shall play a game of chess, \n Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door. \n When Lil's husband got demobbed, I said-- \n I didn't mince my words, I said to her myself, \n HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME \n Now Albert's coming back, make yourself a bit smart. \n He'll want to know what you done with that money he gave you \n To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there. \n You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set, \n He said, I swear, I can't bear to look at you. \n And no more can't I, I said, and think of poor Albert, \n He's been in the army four years, he wants a good time, \n And if you don't give it him, there's others will, I said. \n Oh is there, she said. Something o' that, I said. \n Then I'll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look. \n HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME \n If you don't like it you can get on with it, I said. \n Others can pick and choose if you can't. \n But if Albert makes off, it won't be for lack of telling. \n You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique. \n (And her only thirty-one.) \n I can't help it, she said, pulling a long face, \n It's them pills I took, to bring it off, she said. \n (She's had five already, and nearly died of young George.) \n The chemist said it would be all right, but I've never been the same. \n You are a proper fool, I said. \n Well, if Albert won't leave you alone, there it is, I said, \n What you get married for if you don't want children? \n HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME \n Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon, \n And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot-- \n HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME \n HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME \n Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight. \n Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight. \n Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night. \n III. The Fire Sermon \n The river's tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf \n Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind \n Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed. \n Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song. \n The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers, \n Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends \n Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed. \n And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors; \n Departed, have left no addresses. \n By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . . \n Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song, \n Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long. \n But at my back in a cold blast I hear \n The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear. \n A rat crept softly through the vegetation \n Dragging its slimy belly on the bank \n While I was fishing in the dull canal \n On a winter evening round behind the gashouse \n Musing upon the king my brother's wreck \n And on the king my father's death before him. \n White bodies naked on the low damp ground \n And bones cast in a little low dry garret, \n Rattled by the rat's foot only, year to year. \n But at my back from time to time I hear \n The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring \n Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. \n O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter \n And on her daughter \n They wash their feet in soda water \n Et O ces voix d'enfants, chantant dans la coupole! \n Twit twit twit \n Jug jug jug jug jug jug \n So rudely forc'd. \n Tereu \n Unreal City \n Under the brown fog of a winter noon \n Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant \n Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants \n C.i.f. London: documents at sight, \n Asked me in demotic French \n To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel \n Followed by a weekend at the Metropole. \n At the violet hour, when the eyes and back \n Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits \n Like a taxi throbbing waiting, \n I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives, \n Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see \n At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives \n Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea, \n The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights \n Her stove, and lays out food in tins. \n Out of the window perilously spread \n Her drying combinations touched by the sun's last rays, \n On the divan are piled (at night her bed) \n Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays. \n I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs \n Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest-- \n I too awaited the expected guest. \n He, the young man carbuncular, arrives, \n A small house agent's clerk, with one bold stare, \n One of the low on whom assurance sits \n As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire. \n The time is now propitious, as he guesses, \n The meal is ended, she is bored and tired, \n Endeavours to engage her in caresses \n Which still are unreproved, if undesired. \n Flushed and decided, he assaults at once; \n Exploring hands encounter no defence; \n His vanity requires no response, \n And makes a welcome of indifference. \n (And I Tiresias have foresuffered all \n Enacted on this same divan or bed; \n I who have sat by Thebes below the wall \n And walked among the lowest of the dead.) \n Bestows one final patronising kiss, \n And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . . \n She turns and looks a moment in the glass, \n Hardly aware of her departed lover; \n Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass: \n \"Well now that's done: and I'm glad it's over.\" \n When lovely woman stoops to folly and \n Paces about her room again, alone, \n She smoothes her hair with automatic hand, \n And puts a record on the gramophone. \n \"This music crept by me upon the waters\" \n And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street. \n O City city, I can sometimes hear \n Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street, \n The pleasant whining of a mandoline \n And a clatter and a chatter from within \n Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls \n Of Magnus Martyr hold \n Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold. \n The river sweats \n Oil and tar \n The barges drift \n With the turning tide \n Red sails \n Wide \n To leeward, swing on the heavy spar. \n The barges wash \n Drifting logs \n Down Greenwich reach \n Past the Isle of Dogs. \n Weialala leia \n Wallala leialala \n Elizabeth and Leicester \n Beating oars \n The stern was formed \n A gilded shell \n Red and gold \n The brisk swell \n Rippled both shores \n Southwest wind \n Carried down stream \n The peal of bells \n White towers \n Weialala leia \n Wallala leialala \n \"Trams and dusty trees. \n Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew \n Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees \n Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe.\" \n \"My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart \n Under my feet. After the event \n He wept. He promised a 'new start.' \n I made no comment. What should I resent?\" \n \"On Margate Sands. \n I can connect \n Nothing with nothing. \n The broken fingernails of dirty hands. \n My people humble people who expect \n Nothing.\" \n la la \n To Carthage then I came \n Burning burning burning burning \n O Lord Thou pluckest me out \n O Lord Thou pluckest \n burning \n IV. Death by Water \n Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead, \n Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell \n And the profit and loss. \n A current under sea \n Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell \n He passed the stages of his age and youth \n Entering the whirlpool. \n Gentile or Jew \n O you who turn the wheel and look to windward, \n Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you. \n V. What the Thunder Said \n After the torchlight red on sweaty faces \n After the frosty silence in the gardens \n After the agony in stony places \n The shouting and the crying \n Prison and palace and reverberation \n Of thunder of spring over distant mountains \n He who was living is now dead \n We who were living are now dying \n With a little patience \n Here is no water but only rock \n Rock and no water and the sandy road \n The road winding above among the mountains \n Which are mountains of rock without water \n If there were water we should stop and drink \n Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think \n Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand \n If there were only water amongst the rock \n Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit \n Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit \n There is not even silence in the mountains \n But dry sterile thunder without rain \n There is not even solitude in the mountains \n But red sullen faces sneer and snarl \n From doors of mudcracked houses \n If there were water \n And no rock \n If there were rock \n And also water \n And water \n A spring \n A pool among the rock \n If there were the sound of water only \n Not the cicada \n And dry grass singing \n But sound of water over a rock \n Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees \n Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop \n But there is no water \n Who is the third who walks always beside you? \n When I count, there are only you and I together \n But when I look ahead up the white road \n There is always another one walking beside you \n Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded \n I do not know whether a man or a woman \n --But who is that on the other side of you? \n What is that sound high in the air \n Murmur of maternal lamentation \n Who are those hooded hordes swarming \n Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth \n Ringed by the flat horizon only \n What is the city over the mountains \n Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air \n Falling towers \n Jerusalem Athens Alexandria \n Vienna London \n Unreal \n A woman drew her long black hair out tight \n And fiddled whisper music on those strings \n And bats with baby faces in the violet light \n Whistled, and beat their wings \n And crawled head downward down a blackened wall \n And upside down in air were towers \n Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours \n And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells. \n In this decayed hole among the mountains \n In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing \n Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel \n There is the empty chapel, only the wind's home. \n It has no windows, and the door swings, \n Dry bones can harm no one. \n Only a cock stood on the rooftree \n Co co rico co co rico \n In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust \n Bringing rain \n Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves \n Waited for rain, while the black clouds \n Gathered far distant, over Himavant. \n The jungle crouched, humped in silence. \n Then spoke the thunder \n DA \n Datta: what have we given? \n My friend, blood shaking my heart \n The awful daring of a moment's surrender \n Which an age of prudence can never retract \n By this, and this only, we have existed \n Which is not to be found in our obituaries \n Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider \n Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor \n In our empty rooms \n DA \n Dayadhvam: I have heard the key \n Turn in the door once and turn once only \n We think of the key, each in his prison \n Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison \n Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours \n Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus \n DA \n Damyata: The boat responded \n Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar \n The sea was calm, your heart would have responded \n Gaily, when invited, beating obedient \n To controlling hands \n I sat upon the shore \n Fishing, with the arid plain behind me \n Shall I at least set my lands in order? \n London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down \n Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina \n Quando fiam uti chelidon--O swallow swallow \n Le Prince d'Aquitaine a la tour abolie \n These fragments I have shored against my ruins \n Why then Ile fit you.

Alas, none of that happened to the degree I expected it to. \n I had expectations for this book because of the various poems or parts of poems I saw floating around Tumblr. I was intrigued by those fragmented verses so I gave this a go. While Milk and Honey did not exceed my expectations, I did feel the emotions infused in most of the poems. I sympathized, agreed, and acknowledged the parts I could relate to. While that was all lovely and did merit the 3 stars, I could not see the mechanisms at play behind the poetry. Yes, the illustrations were beautiful and relative. Yes, the words were dipped in profundity and truth. I can see why many love this book but taking a critical poetry course made me look at all types of poems in a different light. It was the random assortment of poetic lines that nagged at me. Hitting enter every couple of words is what seemed to be going on here on the excessive level. And that took a lot away from my reading experience. I'm all for free verse, expressing yourself how ever you want, doing your own thing, etc, and I may be incorrect assuming this but making something look visually pretty on paper just for the sake of looking pretty made me feel as if I was cheated from the content. \n I tried to love it but this was simply not my ideal cup of tea.","date":"2016-12-17"}

{"book_id":"46199","rating":5,"review_text":"Originally published in 1929, 'Letters to a Young Poet' in my opinion has gone much beyond the realm of private conversation between two individuals. Rilke in his letters writes addressing a young officer - Kappus - about the art of writing poetry, love, life, and suffering. \n Isn't it fascinating how pieces of advice can travel through ages and still sound perfectly relevant? As if all our lives are echoes from another time, living the same uncertainties, flaws and having similar longings. Rilke celebrates solitude, individuality and above all the Self. His idea of living the questions is slightly reminiscent of Keat's Negative Capability. \n Grateful to @penguinbooks for publishing a Little Black Classic edition of this book.

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":3,"review_text":"This was quite good, and I'm glad I listened to the audiobook, since the author did the narration. It is written in verse, so I think it having been read aloud really helped for me. \n It was interesting to see how she grew up and that she didn't think herself smart, and yet she became such a good writer. She always was telling stories, and struggled to learn to write it seemed, but the way this is written, you wouldn't have thought so - at least, I was surprised to learn she wasn't great in school. This, I think, is also a good lesson for children (the 'intended audience') to understand. It's great to do well in school, but if you aren't good at everything, that's okay, and it is still important to find a passion and/or what you are good at, and pursue that. \n What I would have liked to know, and this might have been left our because it was written for children, was how her mother was able to afford a place in New York as a single parent with 4 children, and as a black woman, at the time..... Kids probably to think about this, but I kept thinking it throughout. I know she mentions that she shared one room with all her siblings, and they didn't have a lot of food like syrup in the beginning, but still.

She writes poetry in the vein of early 20s heartbreak, but she does it so well that you want to share them with people. Seemingly scratched out doodles accompany many of the free-form poems, and they are a lot smarter and more complicated than they initially appear. I think what makes it so good is that she's smart enough to know this is a debut book and she'll do much greater work in the future, and you can feel this vibrant, passionate, motivated, going-somewhere-amazing person observing the poems, knowing some are cliches and embracing them anyway because they are how she feels in that moment.

About half of it is repetitions of, \"I yearned for love, I lost myself in her mystery, it was passionate, now we've changed.\" And then a bit of it is stuff I plain didn't understand, either because I'm not smart enough or because I'm just not twenty anymore. For example: \n Pale and lashed to my ravenous water, \n I cruise in the sour smell of the naked climate, \n still dressed in gray and bitter sounds \n and a sad crest of abandoned spray. \n from \"Drunk with Pines\" \n Every time I almost understand that stanza, the third line throws me off. The preceding stanza is about passionate kissing, and the following stanza is about sex, so this one should be about some kind of amorous activity, but I can't imagine what Neruda was doing that involved grayness and bitter sounds.

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":4,"review_text":"Woodson writes on a high level, which is both a strength and a limitation. There are individual poems in here- \"the right way to speak\" (p. 68) and \"the fabric store\" (p. 90)- that stand alone and should be studied. There is also the overwhelming weight and breadth of the book. It covers a girl's childhood, three cities, multiple generations, race in the civil rights era, gender, and religion all in 320 pages. Woodson is able to do this because she writes on such a high level, but she loses a lot of readers in the process. \n This book was a candidate for the Newbery a couple years ago. It won the mock Newbery in my reading classes. However, I'm glad the medal went to The Crossover instead, because that's a much more accessible book. I'm currently reading Brown Girl Dreaming with a trio of fairly strong 8th graders, and they're having difficulty with some of it.

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":4,"review_text":"4.5 stars \n I read about 40 pages of this back in September for Diverseathon, but for some reason, I really couldn't get into it then. Maybe it was that I should've have forced myself to read it in such a quick amount of time, because this story definitely warrants taking your time and digesting what it's trying to say. I continually put this off after that, citing that I was bored and didn't want to continue reading if it was going to be something painstaking. \n However, I brought this book home with me for Easter break, wanting to reduce the ridiculous amount of things on my \"currently reading\" pile. I began to pick this up from where I left off, recalling that the last essay/poem I had read was really long and rough to get through, but I told myself that a fresh start would be my motivation to see this with fresh eyes. And i'm so happy I did. \n This book is gorgeous. It's half educational, half eye-opening. I was devastated reading this, and constantly impressed with the quality of the writing, the one-liners, and the depth of emotion to this. The first time I read this, I must not have been in the right state of mind, because this punched me in the gut the second time. I loved almost every single page, and the art and photography interspersed just made it that much more tragic. \n My only complaint is that sometimes Rankine's writing gravitates toward being overly wordy. Several pieces exclude punctuation, which is a stylistic choice many may enjoy, but I'm not a fan and find myself unable to follow easily. Additionally, many longer pieces can lose me in the wordy explanations and long sentences, so I found myself preferring her shorter pieces, even though all presented well-thought out and poignant ideas. \n This must be required reading.

I'm not sure why people go crazy about this book and say it's gorgeous and it's their favorite book, because honestly, it's very plain. Some poems are just basic sentences with random skips that have no real point, they aren't too lyrical, and it's literally just like reading a normal sentence. I expected I would love every page of this, but I only marked 4 poems. This just was nothing new. The concepts in this poem, especially when it rolled around to the feminism aspects, just didn't wow me. An entire poem just about \"you don't NEED a man you WANT a man\" was just a repeat of things I've been hearing for years. It wasn't interesting, and a lot of the poems just sounded so pretentious because it was just plain text with no punctuation and random skips in the lines being fed to the reader as art. Someone mentioned this was a little too \"Tumblr,\" and I agree. It was a quick read, but just a little bit frustrating because it was too simple, too familiar.

{"book_id":"46199","rating":5,"review_text":"In his own introduction to the Letters to a Young Poet, Franz Kappus describes how, in 1902, he was a young man struggling to reconcile his artistic ambitions with his impending military career. After learning from a favourite professor of his at the Military Academy of Vienna that Rainer Maria Rilke had once been a student at the same institution, Kappus wrote to Rilke, enclosing some of his own poems, in the belief that the poet would understand his moral and artistic dilemma. A couple of months later, Rilke wrote back and so began a period of correspondence that lasted some five years. Following the poet's death in 1929, Kappus published the ten letters he received from Rilke, wisely omitting his own side of the correspondence, as Letters to a Young Poet, a collection of thoughtful advice and kindly inspiration that still resonates more than a century after the letters were originally written. \n Rilke's letters to Kappus provide a marvellous window into the thoughts of one of the most important European poets of the modern age at a time when Rilke was just beginning to develop his signature style and accept that he must continue to write even though his talent was no guarantee of the financial success and respectability that he had been socially conditioned to seek. Although the Letters now speak to a wide audience, they were originally written to Kappus alone and this sense of the individual nature of Rilke's advice is a great part of the book's appeal. Perhaps remembering his own struggles with determining the course of his life, Rilke offers powerful advice for Kappus and every aspiring artist: \n \"Go into yourself and test the deeps in which your life takes rise; at its source you will find the answer to the question whether you must create. Accept it, just as it sounds, without inquiring into it. Perhaps it will turn out that you are called to be an artist.\" \n While Rilke is always very kind in his analysis of Kappus' own poetry and, in fact, suggests that it is the poet himself who is best placed to determine the worth of his work, he does offer advice on harnessing creativity and recognising inspiration: \n \"Make use of whatever you find about you to express yourself, the images from your dreams and the things in your memory. If your everyday life seems to lack material, do not blame it; blame yourself, tell yourself that you are not poet enough to summon up its riches; for there is no lack for him who creates and no poor, trivial place.\" \n As well as offering remarkable insight into the artistic temperament and the drive to create, Rilke's beautiful and emotional replies to Kappus explore a huge range of subjects with a sense of delicate and passionate sensitivity which will be familiar to readers of Rilke's poetry. Rilke's Letters contain insights on creativity, solitude, love, sexuality and other perennial aspects of the human condition that are just as profound today as when they were written. Given that the Letters were never intended to be collected or complied, it is a testament to their power and insight that Letters to a Young Poet has, since the collection's appearance in 1929, become Rilke's most widely read book.","date":"2017-05-09"}

To write very simply but sharply, especially about love, loss, and trauma, is a skill set most don't possess and that is so, so much more difficult than I think most people realize. Analyzing the poems individually based on a very limiting set of criteria is a shortcut.

{"book_id":"2696","rating":2,"review_text":"While I can give it some merit as a literary masterwork, what I will definitely say to you if you plan on trekking Ye Olde English tales is this: read it as historical fiction. It's a tough read in terms of deciphering its complex characters and even harder language. This of course doesn't make it bad as a book, just a dry and oddly fatty chew. The way that poetry is used to tell such tales is set up so well and flows, even if it takes a few reads to get the damn point across. And if you can put up with the medieval elitism then give it a shot too. I for one got a little tired of each character's morality lesson being attributed to God if they succeeded or failure of their poor morals if they weren't successful.

And to me, if you can capture something abstract and make it something that everyone wants to share, that is good. Even if the words are simple and the meter is mixed and the verse is basic.

We gravitate towards these kinds of stories of unbridled treachery with great enthusiasm, entranced by the swirling vortex of the male anti-hero, destroying everything around them in the search for meaning.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"Check the review out here!!!! \n http://booksieblog.blogspot.com/2016/... \n milk and honey is a collection of poetry by Rupi Kaur about abuse, love, womanhood, and acceptance. It's a very important book that every woman should read in their lifetime (even if they usually hate poetry, like me). \n This book is absolutely stunning. I've read amazing reviews about it and have seem some pictures of poems in here floating through Twitter, so I had pretty high expectations. This book met all those expectations and then some. \n It's written in a style that's elegant. I felt the poems speak to me personally and also give me a view into stuff that wasn't relatable. There are also some lovely drawings to compliment some of the poems. These weren't amazingly detailed drawings, but simple and helped with the story. The drawings sometimes spoke to me more than the poems. They were an amazing addition. \n There's a lot going on in these poems, but the parts that stuck with me most were the parts about loving yourself. There's great relationship advice and there's also relationship abuse in here, which hurt my heart. The sexuality in the book wasn't gross or unnecessary. It was mentioned beautifully and was a key aspect to the book. I know the whole feminist \"you're body's a flower\" thing annoys some people, but there's so much more than that here. \n milk and honey helped me, in a way. Even though it only took me fifteen minutes to read this, it still had a big impact on me. There were some poems that I really loved and wanted to share with the world. This book is so important and so powerful. If you haven't read this already, why not? It's worth it. \n (Also this isn't really a self-help book but I put it in that bookshelf because it helped me!)","date":"2016-08-12"}

Is something that I don't like to read, I don't like to analyse and certainly, don't like to create. BUT, Lang Leav has made me see poetry with other eyes. Something that now even Shakespeare or Edgar Allan Poe could do. I still don't love poetry, but I'm certainly seeing it with other eyes now. \n The first book, Love & Misadventure, filled something inside of me that I did not knew that it needed filling. Something inside of me craved this type of poetry. To open my mind to a new world of possibilities. Words can be magical to describe the perfect settings or to narrate the best scenes, but poetry give you only a glimpse for you to imagine everything. \n Her books, this one included, does not follow and order. Everything is scramble up and that is the beauty of it. All our feelings take place in the same place of ourselves, so her different poetry is all living in the same book. But the highs and lows are terrible, terrible for my feels. In one poem, I'm very in love and in the other I'm bittersweet or super sad. There's no in between and again, that's the beauty of it. \n Poetry is not only written with poems. Narration has poetry. Dialogue has poetry. A single word can have even more poetry than a hundred verses poem. This book gives you that example. The whole book is poetry, but not all of it is shown in poems.

The hype around this collection is enormous (especially among teen girls--Instagram is filled with screenshots of this book). So I skimmed a few poems and was disappointed to find each one plain and cliche. The line breaks felt cheesy. The language was overly simple. \n But I got it from the library anyway, and this morning I read it alone in my apartment, wrapped up in a blanket and drinking coffee. I got chills. I actually said \"ooh\" out loud at five different places. I cried and felt so uplifted as a woman. \n I think that before, what I saw as oversimplification was actually clarity. The language is so heartbreakingly basic--anyone's story can fit in these lines. I confused overexposure for cliche. There's a reason these lines are all over the teenage side of the internet. Where else are girls told that their body is their own? That body hair is okay and that sweetness and bitterness are both manageable and essential? \n This book is not meant to be skimmed. Read it all at once, straight through. Write down the lines that you feel like a punch to the gut or a hand on your cheek. Don't go into it expecting trite Tumblr poetry like I did.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"** spoiler alert ** \n Milk and Honey is an interesting collection of poems. It's divided into 4 parts; The Hurting, The Loving, The Breaking, and The Healing. My favorite part in order: The Breaking, The Loving, The Healing, then The Hurting. \n I think I'm still attracted to sadness (thus the order). The Hurting was quite hard for me to read because I guess Rupi Kaur is great at illustrating the situation. I got carried away a bit and felt some kind of uncomfortable feeling while reading the part. Some poems are relatable in 'The Hurting', others not so much (just like any other book). \n The Breaking was 85% relatable (how the f I measured this?) to me. Here's an excerpt from one of my favorite poems in 'The Breaking' part: \n \"the woman who comes after me will be a bootleg version of who i am. she will try and write poems for you to erase the ones i've left memorized on your lips but her lines could never punch you in the stomach the way mine did.\" \n Also this one, \n \"how cruel i was to myself. giving you credit for my warmth simply because you had felt it. thinking it was you who gave me strength. wit. beauty. simply because you recognized it. as if i was already not these things before i met you. as if i did not remain all these once you left.\" \n I really like the last excerpt. \n Some words/plot try to be profound be fall flat and predictable like... \n \"you might not have been my first love but you were the love that made all the other loves irrelevant.\" \n WHAT? That poem sounds like a Tinder pickup line. \n However, though Rupi Kaur can certainly write \"poems\", I'm still not quite sure whether this book is considered as a collection of poems or rather fragmented sentences. Her writings are more like (hipster) quotes rather than poems. \n Overall, I think I started my journey on modern poetry with quite alright note. I should've read Sarah Kay's first, but I don't know why but I strongly believe that Milk and Honey is not just a book with too many space and enter lines. Certainly, I'd like to believe that it is much better than Lang Leav's books.","date":"2016-12-12"}

I just kept waiting for the WOW factor that never really came. There are weird story parts that aren't really poems at all. Just a bunch of fragmented sentences and weirdly placed periods. On top of that, there were a lot of repeat type poems that had the same message or same lines just phrased differently but they would occur a few pages apart and I felt like we were suppose to have moved on from that but life is always jumping back and forth, I guess. \n I'm not sure if the ten I really enjoyed and thought were really spectacular were the original parts picked for this book and everything else is filler (I mean it really feels that way), but I just didn't see the hype. I can see where a lot of people have convinced themselves it's good (when it's not) because the messages are really positive and needed, especially with diversity and feminism. \n One part I was impressed with was the author's poem/message to other young poets about how the poetry doesn't have to please the reader, it only has to speak to the writer's soul. In that case, I feel like this review isn't needed. I can agree with that; your writing should be for you. I just wish I hadn't had to spend $15+ on something so...lacking.","date":"2016-09-21"}
{"book_id":"171547","rating":4,"review_text":"Surprised by the rhyming scheme and imagery, these poems, published in 1789, were entirely readable and thoroughly enjoyable. Heavily influenced by Christian symbolism, Blake used his poetry to advocate against the slave trade and the conditions in which children had to work as chimney sweeps.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"Frankly, I was disappointed. For the cost, there was very little text, which is always okay if the writing brings great value. Milk and Honey did not. This book poorly passes for free verse poetry and while the messages are well meant I cannot say that the writing was anything more than predictable. Common themes are perfectly fine if the author brings a fresh voice. Milk and Honey was repetitive, boring, and left me feeling unfulfilled and dissatisfied. I had heard wonderful things but was left questioning the advice of my friends. \n I'm sure there are people who enjoy this work. I will not go about as other reviewers have done with insulting those who praise this book. The messaging can be moving for some, but I have simply read far too much poetry to consider this a true masterpiece or a favorite book like some have discussed. \n This book means a lot to the author; this is very clear within the notes written in the book. It simply does not mean a lot to me. I wish to add that I really wanted to like this book. I went into it rooting for the author, but despite how hard I tried, I couldn't give it a review greater than I think it deserved. I wish the author and the reader all the best.","date":"2016-08-08"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"** spoiler alert ** \n So I am not a big poetry person, I mean I appreciate it, but it's hard for me to read. Which is why I usually shy away from poetry/poetry collections, but I had heard so many good things about Milk and Honey that when I saw it a store recently I decided to get it. Then randomly today I started to read it and holy crap this was so good. \n The poems in this book are beautifully written and the journey Rupi Kaur takes you on in each section is so tragic, yet hopeful. There are so many parts/poems that stick out to me in this book, but I think her sections The Breaking and The Healing hit me the most and I felt I could relate to them more than the other sections. \n The two that stick out to me are: \n \"i don't know what living with a balanced life feels like \n when i am sad \n i don't cry i pour \n when i am happy \n i don't smile i glow \n when i am angry \n i don't yell i burn\" (pg. 109) \n Then the other one was: \n \"the thing about writing is \n i can't tell if it's healing \n or destroying me\" (pg. 148) \n With the first poem, I could relate to that section so much because that's how I am. To me it meant that she doesn't have a middle ground with her emotions, that her emotions go from 0 to 100 which I can relate to. When I'm really emotional, there is no middle ground for me. \n The second poem spoke to me because as someone who loves to write and continues to struggle with her writing, the thought of her being conflicted on whether or not her writing is helping or hurting is actually something I've struggled with and felt before. Writing is never easy, it is complex, and can be a very emotional experience, so her suggesting it might heal you or destroy you was so powerful to me. \n Lastly, I also really loved the little sketches that went with the poems. I think they really added some context to the poems and helped you visualize what she was trying to express with her words. \n Overall, loved the book, going to give it 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend.","date":"2017-02-22"}

{"book_id":"1420","rating":4,"review_text":"Shakespeare's Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is, like Julius Caesar one of those plays which have become almost an institution in the English: so often quoted from that even those who have never read them will have heard these quotes. There is a divinity that shapes our ends..., This above all, to thine own self be true..., To be, or not to be; that is the question.... The story in itself is a tempestuous one of deceit, betrayal, intrigue and tragic accident: Hamlet, prince of Denmark, encounters his father's ghost and is told by the spirit that he was murdered by his own brother, who poured poison into his ear in order to gain both his throne and his wife. \n ... And this is the start of Hamlet's mad rush towards revenge, a hankering for vengeance that will see him destroy not just the murderer who is now King and stepfather to him, but also many others. There is plotting, intrigue, suspicion on all sides. There is love, given up and betrayed; there is ambition and anger, self-destructive hopelessness and deceit. \n But, as with much of Shakespeare--especially his tragedies--it is not the story that matters; it is the dialogue. Some, granted, may now seem too obscure and hard to understand for the average reader without the benefit of notes. Most of it, however, is poetry at its finest: wise, philosophical, speaking of a deep understanding of human nature (Hamlet's confrontation of his mother, for instance, is a brilliant example of hurt and betrayal spoken out loud). There is even the occasional instance of wit. \n Worth a read, and worth all the praise it's garnered over the centuries.","date":"2016-04-17"}

I found nothing revolutionary inside these pages.

Poetry might just be something I'll never grow to appreciate, I guess. Therefore, for me, milk and honey felt both disconnected yet connected at the same time, as contradicting as that sounds.

It incorporated all the famous myths I already knew (and some unknown ones I haven't heard before) but also put them all in context and sequence. \n Ovid's Metamorphoses documents the origin and creation of the world up until the life of the poet himself. There are some familiar segments pulled from \n The Iliad \n (my review), \n The Odyssey \n , and \n The Aeneid \n (my review). We see recurring characters and gods/goddesses from those works and many more recognizable myths. \n \"Omnia mutantur, nihil interit.\" (Everything changes, nothing perishes.) \n The series of stories divided out between the 15 books portray the most essential theme: the change and transformation of things or people into different forms, hence \"metamorphoses.\" Ovid does this in a careful and considered manner making the translated prose quite tricky but still beautiful (I read this in translated English but I do remember reading and translating some passages of this in Latin when I took the language in the past). \n As for something I found intriguing, were the recurring commonalities found in a lot of these stories. Often times a myth would begin with Jupiter (or Zeus) falling under lust and raping some young and unwilling maiden. Juno (or Hera) would be filled with jealousy upon discovering her husband's infidelity, and she usually would find a way to make the maiden's life miserable. She does so successfully and most of the women end up crying and morphing into rivers/streams/other bodies of water (or the occasional tree). Sometimes there's a diversifying story where it'll focus on the men's tragic lives instead. In that case, the man is usually transformed into a bird by the end. But of course, no surprise, as most Roman and Greek literature, there was a lot of sex, violence, and bad decisions (which led to tragic deaths) caused by fate. But again, transformation is a huge idea that pops up time and time again (along with idea that there are divine consequences when denying a god/goddess). \n Anyway, instead of continuing to describe the events of Metamorphoses I'd liked to go ahead and just end this review here. What really made Metamorphoses stand out to me in comparison to other epic poetry was how it was written. Ovid shares these myths and stories by allowing them to be more episodic than a continual narrative, which made the reading feel not as heavy despite the overall length. After reading, I can easily recognize why the great Ovid influenced many works of art and entertainment made by famous individuals (including Shakespeare, a list of Renaissance and Baroque artists, and also more recent painters from the modern movements in the 20th century like Salvador Dali). To sum it up: Metamorphoses is a thick classic with a challenging narrative structure but certainly worth trudging through to gain \"scholar points\" or more knowledge on Greek/Roman mythology. \n --- \n More reviews at Xingsings \n Blog @xingsings | Instagram @readxings | Twitter @xingsings","date":"2016-04-23"}

The whole family is held together through thick and thin by her maternal grandmother and grandfather. This is a clear demonstration of pure love and family dedication to helping each and every member experience success!

Oh, and the mother is a middle school principal which I related to completely (been there and \"done\" that). Wonderful book for all ages but especially for middle schoolers.

I had to read and let the words marinate in my psyche. I don't feel so alone now. All people especially Black people should read this book.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"I'm actually a world-renowned poetry-hater. I hate it and it makes no sense. Don't try and convince me, otherwise. Rupi Kaur has literally changed my opinion of that. Her writing is stunning and artful and truthful and unlike any other, and she manages to be herself in a world full of ordinary.(One of the only bummer points about this, I was immensely spoiled beforehand because many pages of this book have already been photo-copied onto tumblr, so yeah.) \n This book is separated into parts: the hurting, the loving, the breaking, and the healing, respectively, and certain poems are accompanied with appropriate images. In it, she faces tribulations of life, alludes to her own personal struggles, romantic and familial, and teaches us, as women, how to succeed through these obstacles. \n What annoys me about poetry is how everything is broken into stanzas. I know many readers had the same problem with The Princess Saves Herself In This One, which is why I'm not going to read that. If I wanted, I could hit the Enter key and create literary magic, too. \n nothing is safer \n than the sound of you \n reading out loud to me \n (...) \n to be \n soft \n is \n to be \n powerful \n Surely, I wasn't the only one annoyed by this. \n But that's beside the point. This is undeniably a fantastic book and I actually cried over it, believe it or not. I actually reread it, too. Since I read it in one sitting - the night it arrived - and I read it again, the bus ride home. It's a short read, around 200 pages. Although, most books of poetry are observed to be short, I've noticed. Grab a copy and cry over it, so you can understand my feelings.","date":"2016-11-16"}

I definitely missed half the importsnt points in the book. Things didn't click into place until around page 50... and there's only 67 pages. But those last 17 pages were gold, so there's that.

{"book_id":"13105527","rating":2,"review_text":"I have mixed feelings about anthologies, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that I would have mixed feelings about poem books too. This time I tried reading this book when I'm in a more contemplative mood, and maybe it did help a little, I suppose? \n I have to say, I don't like the pictures. I don't feel like it adds value to the poems at all, and in comparison to the words, they pale in art. The poems are okay - some I actually enjoy. My favourite is \"The Twins\" and it goes like this: \n \"I like to think that somewhere out there, on a planet exactly like ours, two people exactly like you and me made totally different choices and that, somewhere, we're still together.\" \n I thought that the idea of doppelgangers in an alternative universe making the choices that you wish you have made, is quite a sweet but sad way of describing a breakup. \n Other than that, I'm pretty much 'meh' about this book, although I'm appreciative of the way the tone picks up towards the end. It had a nice message at the end too, so that wasn't too bad.","date":"2017-04-29"}
{"book_id":"18003300","rating":2,"review_text":"I'm not a poem person, and it becomes real obvious when I actually sighed in relief upon encountering a passage rather than a poem. I also found that reading poems after poems give me a sizeable headache and I kinda realise perhaps this is not the correct way to appreciate a book on poems. \n ANYWAY, (unfortunately) I cannot say I detest this book because I do agree that the author made being sad and heartbroken look awfully attractive. And I'm generally a sad person, and I do find beauty in sadness so yes I was a little bit sucked into that toxicity. But my beauty in sadness isn't because a person is sad, but because a person remains strong in sadness. I'm not even sure if I grasped the storyline correctly in this book (remember I'm not good with poems and I kinda skimmed over after a while), but I cannot quite understand why the protagonist is feeling sad all the time. I may relate to certain sentences and find them poetic, but I am relating to them on my own context. If I strip them of that and assess these poems as one full story, my only question is \"what the fuck does this girl want from her relationship?\" Seriously all she does is mope and whine and even at the end, her heart is still broken at love etc. If this was a story instead of a collection of poems, I would've flung this book out of the window. So yes it's a two stars because it's a book of poems and I was distracted by the pretty (empty) words. \n Frankly I only read this book because there was an article explaining how toxic this author's poems are, and I was curious. But yes, I completely agree on the toxicity of these poems and how it glorifies sadness (there was also a small part of self-harming or was I reading too much into the poems?). Pining for a one-sided love and feeling heartbroken are all normal life events but to focus one's existence entirely on this is too narrow-minded and shallow. Please, if you're reading this because you're sad and broken, you can but please don't ever think that your life is going to center around this brokenness because it's not. Your life will pick up. And you will learn to love again. \n And there is no glory or prize to win for being a pretty sad girl.","date":"2017-04-27"}

I got some of the poems and even liked some but maybe it's not just for me. I don't usually read them anyway but I kinda got obsessed with some on pintrest and why I also bought this book. \n It's not all bad but I don't have anything to really say about these ones. I finished the book without a single thought for them. Neither of any did also touch me. \n The only good thing I can say is that it's takes guts to write about the thing you have gone through and Rupi Kaur did that with these poems.","date":"2017-09-06"}

I highly recommend this short bit of classics for everyone. \n However, if you're a writer of any sort -- *any* sort -- then this little book contains a map to your soul, and I recommend shelving it with your bibles and reaching for it often.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"I enjoy her performance more than her writing. When I read her work as a written form, I feel like understanding her work as a segmented part of the whole body. She wrote in a very simple yet explicit sentences. Each of the pages doesn't relate to one another with the exception of chaptering; the hurting, loving, breaking and healing. There are few illustration following the poem which is quite expressive but not really help to support the poetry. If I have to judge her as a mere writer, i'll give her one star for the book.

But at one point I had to put the book down at a bar because I started tearing up over my beer. \n This can either be a really good intro to poetry or something to turn you off forever it just depends on your preferences. These remind me of little mantras or poems to meditate on for a bit.

{"book_id":"269322","rating":4,"review_text":"Be nothing which thou art not. \n Overview 4/5 stars \n I don't read much of any poetry. Apart from poems I've read for school (way back when), this is my first book of poetry I've ever read. I will be reading more poetry from now on as I thoroughly enjoyed this. \n Poe is well known for the Raven, which everyone has heard at some point. Even the Simpsons recited it during a tree house of horror episode. His other works are also brilliant. There are, of course, a few misses but for the most part everything is great. \n The raven \n This is now my favourite poem ever. I'm currently looking on amazon to see if I can get the poem in a frame to put on a wall in my house, it's that good. If you don't check out any of the other poems, you must read the raven. \n I've read this every night before bed since starting this collection. Very few writers can command language like Poe. Here are some of my favourite lines. \n But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. \n But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door \n Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door! \n I could copy the whole thing as every word is placed brilliantly. \n Other favourites \n Amongst my favourites were Tamerlane, Alone, Elizabeth, Lenore, The City in the Sea, The Sleeper, The Valley of Unrest and Dreamland. \n Most of the poems are gothic in nature and are rather haunting, though beautiful. Here are just some of my favourite bits. First up is a beaut from Dreamland: \n By the lakes that thus outspread Their lone waters, lone and dead,--Their sad waters, sad and chilly With the snows of the lolling lily,--By the mountains--near the river Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,--By the gray woods,--by the swamp Where the toad and the newt encamp,--By the dismal tarns and pools Where dwell the Ghouls,--By each spot the most unholy--In each nook most melancholy,--There the traveller meets aghast Sheeted Memories of the past--Shrouded forms that start and sigh As they pass the wanderer by--White-robed forms of friends long given, In agony, to the Earth--and Heaven. \n Would to God I could awaken For I dream I know not how, And my soul is sorely shaken Lest an evil step be taken,--Lest the dead who is forsaken May not be happy now. \n My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep, As it is lasting, so be deep; Soft may the worms about her creep! \n For no ripples curl, alas! Along that wilderness of glass--No swellings tell that winds may be Upon some far-off happier sea--No heavings hint that winds have been On seas less hideously serene. \n \"Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride, And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died! How shall the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung By you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?\" \n Read nothing, written less -in short's a fool \n And all I loved--I loved alone \n And boyhood is a summer sun Whose waning is the dreariest one--For all we live to know is known, And all we seek to keep hath flown \n Darkness there and nothing more...","date":"2017-01-28"}

I'm black but not American and I wanted to read something acclaimed that talked about the experience over there because though it not perfect here, it's no where near the crazy over there. \n I did not rate this book because I don't think I am qualified to rate this type of book. I can have an opinion but I can't rate the way it was written because I have never read any poetry before and frankly I didn't like it. I don't like the way the prose is constructed. Sentences I can't even read in a familiar rhythm because , even though they are written in simple English, they don't make sense when read all together. \n Ex. If they he she we you were to concluded yesterday to know whatever was done could also be done, was also done, was never done - \n How about whole sections of prose with little to no punctuation which is my biggest pet peeve of life \n Ex. As he walked across grass still green from summer walking out of the rain a step beyond into a piece of sky dry all day for him in this moment a shelter as he sat beneath the overhanging branches of the \"white tree \"surprising himself at the centre of the schoolyard thinking of the slight give in the cushions of the counter seats he had read about in textbooks did the hardness of the ground across the hardness of the seats in buses as he waited to be noticed listening to the lift and fall of the leaves above him? \n I'm just not into poetry it would seem. I can't connect fully. I wish I could have a better understanding of it but most of the time it just seems like a bunch of random words stuck together and in it I'm suppose to find some type of enlightenment. Maybe this one is not the one to get me there but I don't know if I'll try again for a while.","date":"2016-10-02"}

{"book_id":"2547","rating":3,"review_text":"Kahlil Gibran is a name that's been revolving around the fringes of my to-read possibilities. As one of the most widely read writers in the world, how could he not? \n The Prophet combines faith and philosophy in a series of questions and answers on life and death and all the big topics in between, all delivered in a style similar to the Socratic Method...except that it's not really promoting any kind of critical thinking. Yes, there are some fundamental truths to be gleaned herein, same as you'd find in the Bible for example. But then there are passages that essentially say: don't bother learning, you know it all already. I guess you just have to coax it out of yourself by yourself. Or just listen to God. Have faith and you'll know all you need to know. Oh, and don't bother talking. Gibran says talking murders thought. Certainly it's tough to get any thinking done while someone is talking to you, but is really does help your thoughts to evolve when you talk things over with others with experience and wisdom. \n Poetry isn't my thing anymore, so I was hesitant to read The Prophet. Luckily it's not poetry. Well, it's \"prose poetry\". But to me this sort of writing has very little resemblance to poetry...which is a good thing, as far as I'm concerned. However, many of the lines do have a certain poetic flair. There is a melodic flow and it is a pleasure to read, especially when one of Gibran's philosophical tidbits rings true. \n I'm not surprised this saw a resurgence in popularity with the counterculture of the 1960s. This offers up the sort of loose philosophy that would attract those in search of something to believe in outside of organized religion. There was some good to be found within the pages of The Prophet. There was also some good within The Bible. I'd rather read this again though. It's a lot shorter.","date":"2016-02-20"}

{"book_id":"12914","rating":1,"review_text":"There is a certain kind of person who takes solace in the fact that just because a thing outweighs us folks now in years, that it is of a certain value and should be lauded and held high despite its questionable quality. There is something to be said for this argument...up to a certain point. Once we reach far enough back in the past, though, it is too easy for a healthy respect for our ancient forebears to begin to approximate something akin to ass-kissing, as if Virgil and Homer are skulking about the prison shower room, waiting for us to drop the proverbial soap of critical analysis, to let it squeeze out between our fingers should we dare set it aside in favor of something more abrasive. \n I'm not afraid to say that the Aeneid is terrible, come what may in the dark corners of the prison of literature that we find ourselves in. It is bland, uninteresting, and nothing more than a litany of names, lineages, and events conveyed so poorly that I was lost in minutes. I'm sure there's an interesting story in there. In fact, hell yes there is, but the modes of the tell of the ancients are not our own and to pretend to them some kind of value seems, well, sort of insulting. Virgil could care less what we think and that's fine. He'd probably vomit up his own fecal matter if he saw some of the ways we express ourselves (invisible demons, poor spelling, twerking, mentions of fecal matter, or all combined) \n Maybe Virgil was just sort of terrible.

Although not completely unexpected, to my surprise, I was able to finish reading this while I was stuck in traffic with my family. And I'm glad I finally read this. \n The poems that I ended up really liking turned out to be ones that I personally can relate to, or have thought of so in one way or another, myself. It was as if the poems articulated what was in my head at those specific moments in time, but I just wasn't able to convert the thoughts into coherent words and sentences. For some reason, whenever authors do that, I always feel thankful to them. So, thank you Mrs. Kaur. \n For the poems that I couldn't relate to, mainly because I did not have the same experiences, I could still feel, to a degree, the emotions and pain that the author was trying to express. I think an author have succeeded in writing a good piece if they get the readers to feel an emotion they want them to feel. And Mrs. Kaur have definitely achieved that--at least, for me. \n Now having read, \"Milk and Honey,\" I'm definitely interested in reading more poetry books. I like how the poems managed to express emotions through short, condensed sentences with wordings that made what the narrator wanted to convey clear to the readers. I think the simplicity gave a kind of bare and raw feel to it; it's like everything's broken down, laid to its most basic foundation for the readers to see. \n Spoilers-ish: I did not expect for there to be drawings throughout the book; when I opened the first page, I was surprised to see the explicit illustration... However, after that, I got used to it and thought that the pictures actually added to the story. They made the poems feel more alive--somewhat more real. \n ***","date":"2017-01-30"}

\n I know, I know. Neruda and Poe are one of the most famous poets in the whole world and most of you can't understand Kamov's poem (which makes me really sad because it's one of my favorite poems and it's so fucking awesome). How can I compare young Leav to such literary geniuses? \n Here's the thing. Neruda was 20 when he wrote Twenty Love Poems and A Desperate Song. Poe was 40 when he wrote Annabel Lee. Kamov was 19 when he wrote Psovka. And I assume Leav is in her early 20s? \n My point is, the age is no excuse. Yeah, sure, you get better at writing with age (practice), but the fact that she is young does not make for the harsh truth- her poetry is shitty. \n For me, poetry is supposed to move you. It's supposed to make you think, touch your soul, wake up your deepest emotions. \n And let me tell you, I felt absolutely nothing but annoyance and distaste while reading this book. Reading about floss, dishes and tic-tac-toe didn't bring out any emotions in me. I know, shocking. \n I don't think it's one of those 'it's not you, it's me' situations. I don't think that this book is actually good but I simply didn't enjoy it because it's not my thing. I just think, plain and simple, that Leav can't write.","date":"2016-12-06"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"I guess this is why I don't use Tumblr. \n There were a couple of actual poems that I found myself enjoying, and a couple of passages that I felt were meaningful and took pictures of to remember. However, as a whole, this 'poetry collection' is anything but a collection of poetry. It is simply 3 or 4 poems among a sea of near blank pages with sentences split up into separate lines to give the impression that it is 'poetry'. The messages and emotion conveyed in this book are all good and poignant, but the book definitely does not deserve the amount of praise it has received, in my humble opinion. As someone who has studied poetry in school, Kaur's work is lacking in stylistic features and rhythm to convey the raw emotion that I can see in her work. \n In addition to this, I did not realize going into this that this book was so specifically targeted towards women that men could not relate to it in any way, and so I felt very disconnected from Kaur, which may also have had something to do with the rating that I gave it. But mostly it was because this book is labeled as 'poetry', when, in actuality it is a collection of fragmented sentences that attempt to provoke thought through basic diction with blatant denotations, rather than impress the reader with the connotations of the words of a poet.","date":"2017-05-28"}
{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"This post should really be titled \"Why We Need to Stop Talking about Milk and Honey.\" \n Working at a bookstore, I sell dozens of copies of this book every day. \n I hear people say: \n \"This is my favorite book of all time.\" \n \"My friend told me about how great this book is.\" \n \"I can't wait to start reading this!\" \n \"It's so insightful and inspiring to women everywhere.\" \n What I want to know is how they could say ANY of that about THIS book. \n Milk and Honey is broken into 4 sections: Hurting, Loving, Breaking, and Healing. \n The book starts with a young girl getting raped by her father. She witnesses the abuse of her mother at his hands and she wonders how this could be okay. How could someone you love hurt you so bad? It then turns to her first relationship with someone and how the euphoria is so beyond her control. She's happy. But that relationship doesn't end well and she basically hates herself but keeps repeating that she is so much better than him anyway. But the hurt is too strong for her. It ends with her taking control of her life and embracing who she is as a women, but it's still hard to tell what exactly happened.... \n This is told entirely in poems. However, the placement of the poems hardly make sense throughout the book. She also has some pages that literally have a \"poem\" of 4 words. The book also has illustrations to pair with the poems, but again some of them make you stop and say \"What in the hell does that have to do with anything?\" \n So, before you run out and drop $16 on this book, maybe actually find out what it's about. I still haven't quite grasped the full concept and I honestly don't think I ever will. \n Check out more of my reviews at A Reader's Diary.","date":"2017-03-12"}
{"book_id":"20821284","rating":4,"review_text":"This review and more can be found at A Reader's Diary!! \n After picking this book up several times, I finally decided to read it. And I am so glad I did. \n Brown Girl Dreaming is an autobiographical telling of Jacqueline Woodson growing up as an African American girl in the South. It delves into so many social issues from the 1960's and 1970's but even the issues we're having in the world today. Jacqueline was raised the same way as everyone else and deserved to be treated that way. She watched Angela Davis on television every day and held her fist high. She wrote about what she wanted, needed, loved, and missed. She wrote about what she knew, and what she didn't know she made up along the way. This little girl didn't realize she had a hard life. But she knew what she had shaped who she was. With family dying, incarcerated, or just gone, she had to continue with her life. Jacqueline Woodson definitely created a perfect little world for her childhood past. \n Brown Girl Dreaming may be a children's book, but it truly is a book for all ages. \n Written in poetry form, the words literally fly off the page. \n The words form little melodies that will stick with readers for long after they close the book. \n Grab a copy and read her life. \n Might as well add her newest book, Another Brooklyn, to your \"to-read\" list too!

It's emotion is raw and felt deeply. The first section of the book (it is broken into four areas) hit me the hardest, particularly while looking at an upcoming inauguration filled with hate and finger pointing, and distrust and condemning of women. So much of it found wounds I had forgotten of and opened them up again so to pour salt into them.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"my heart woke me crying last night \n how can i help i begged \n my heart said \n write the book - rupi kaur \n In 2014 rupi kaur, an Indian-American then 21 years-old, self published a collection of poems that first appeared on her Instagram feed. Most of her poems are paired with simple ink line drawings adding layers and visual depth. The collection is divided into \"the hurting\", \"the loving\", \"the breaking\", and \"the healing\". \n What Dazzled: Each poem reads like an aphorism. \n your body \n is a museum \n of natural disasters \n can you grasp how \n stunning that is, p. 173. \n I've dog-eared many pages and know I will return to these pages again and again. I am in awe of rupi's drive and confidence with her art, and I'm a bit jealous. At 21 I didn't have the confidence in my writing and never took the leap to put my work out into the world. On her website she discusses why she does not use punctuation or capitalize in her writing. to write punjabi means to use gurmukhi script. and within this script there are no uppercase or lowercase letters. all letters are treated the same. i enjoy how simple that is. \n What Fizzled: The author mostly wrote in the second person point-of-view using the pronoun \"you\", and this was a bit confusing at times. Was she speaking directly to me the reader? Yes, for some poems she was, but other times I couldn't tell if I was suppose to assume the \"you\" was her lover or a self reflection. This made me curious if the first section called \"the hurting\" was speaking for all women or from personal experience. \n Jots and Thoughts: Until a couple of days ago I hadn't made the connection between rupi and the viral instagram posts titled \"period\". I should pay more attention. Find it here on her website. According to her instagram feed book two is in the revision stage. It's been interesting reading other people's reviews of her writing. Some love it and some call it lousy, unworthy of being called poetry. She addresses this in her poem \"to all you young poets\" \n your art \n is not about how many people \n like your work \n your art \n is about \n if your heart likes your work \n if your soul likes your work \n it's about how honest \n you are with yourself \n and you \n must never \n trade honesty \n for relatability. p. 202. \n She loves her poetry, decided to share it, and a lot of people have liked it. I think that's pretty awesome. Listen to rupi talk about her poetry here. *rape and sexual content","date":"2017-04-02"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"\"People go \n but how \n they left \n always stays\" \n Raw, Beautiful, Empowering, Brave and Breath-taking. Milk and Honey is not your ordinary book. It is not a poetry to underestimate with. It tackles feminism and being strong at the deepest core of your feelings. It discusses love and surviving love by yourself. It is pure, enchanting and magnificent all at once. \n \"can someone explain that. how even when the love leaves. it doesn't leave. how even when i am so past you. i am so helplessly brought back to you.\" \n I was hooked by her words that she captures my heart the moment I read her heart. It was painful - so, so painful that I have to take a couple of minute breaks to indulge with suffocating words and yet manipulated by her stunning conscious voice. It feels like I'm listening to a strong advocate who stands to every woman, to every child, to every person who is conflicted emotionally. \n aThis book, the poetry make me feels like drowning and drowning by each time I turn the page. The words are precisely combined with honest emotions that could sip most of your happy memories and turn you into a hollow vessel that is swimming through the darkness of tears. As if you wanted to ripped the pages of her book because of the anger, the sadness, the pain, the loneliness, the sorrow that the author portrays with her ink and papers.b \n I love it. I love Milk and Honey. It is simply stunning! It captures the real emotion of people when they are being for who they don't want to be to the person they are willing to be to the person they chose to be even if they are struggling. It indicates the four part process of moving on, whether you moved on or you didn't -- it is all depends on the readers' perspective. And as for me? I don't think that's moving on. I saw it as accepting for who you are, for what had happened and for standing up not for those you love but standing up for yourself. \n cRupi Kaur, Thank you. Thank you for your words that can enlighten a lot of people. Thank \n you for writing such an exquisite book. Thank you for writing for yourself.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"Full Review. \n I had heard so much about this book that I simply had to read it and now am battling myself about writing a proper review, but will see, I might update this one later. \n Poetry is not just a sentence divided in random places, so it would look good on paper or look like poetry. And these 'poems' seem just like a big scam where people are tricked into believing that they understand it, while in reality there's nothing to not understand, because there's no mystery, everything's spelled out. Which is unlike any other poems I have read. It seems a bit like basically a smart, deep thought or aphorism was just scattered in few lines and called poetry. \n Some things in this book mattered to me, things I liked and could relate to. Some things that touched topics, I've pushed deep in my memory, but mostly things I just frowned upon. \n I believe that if the parts would have been scattered differently in this book, I would have liked it more, because the feminism part was shit. Obviously the author has problems with people telling her to shave (cause it was mentioned three times), which might be a problem is some culture's, with different rights for women, but I somehow think that even with that argument in mind, there are some more noble rights to fight about, like I don't know... choosing who you should marry and stuff? \n No matter what I say though, I know that people 'who generally don't like poetry' will admit that they like this book, because it's just deep sentences with no hidden meanings, and no need to interpret anything, put together. The thing is thought that I generally like poetry and this wasn't it. \n It's like the author wanted to put her soul into a novel, but didn't really know how to write it, so she just wrote core sentences and parts and scattered them inside of novel sized and shaped object.","date":"2016-06-14"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"I'm often cautious of trashing experimental forms on the basis of their deviating from whatever \"proper\" English is supposed to be. I'm also reluctant to bash writers of colour when there is an overabundance of white male authors who are allowed to be perfectly mediocre in peace, and because I know it takes courage to write about subjects like abuse, depression and heartbreak, however clumsily. However, so many acquaintances and even a few family members recommended this author's work to me, and I have to say that \"perplexed\" doesn't even begin to describe how I feel about the praise lavished on this book. \n Echoing a lot of reviewer's sentiments, these aren't poems. They are lovely little ideas that aspire to one day grow up to become poems. They are pithy statements, often one-sentence feminist \"truisms\" or else cutesy affirmations that have been broken up and spaced out by liberal smashes of the 'enter' key. The result is this collection of wispy sweet nothings that are accompanied by admittedly charming little illustrations, and are often titled what is supposed to be the last line of the poem--which could actually be clever, if it weren't so overused. It's the perfect format for maximum social media \"shareability\"; I can see why these circulate as quickly as they do on instagram and tumblr. They're short and sweet enough to hold your attention for as long as it takes to hit the little heart with your thumb, while giving you absolutely nothing to really chew on, much less digest. \n To top it all off, the author is now involved in a squabble over alleged stylistic plagiarism by Nayyirah Waheed, the equally unremarkable and overhyped author of the anthology 'Salt' (a hilariously apt title, in hindsight). Instead of trying to figure out which of the two expressed their love of abusing punctuation --and that poor enter key-- on tumblr first, please just go and read literally anything by Warsan Shire.

Some of the poems felt like basic sentences my mother would orate while baking a lemon pie and telling me how she once suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Other poems proclaim a feminist message that I literally have heard a million times.

Because they repeat not just themes but exact imagery, the individuality of each is lost in a quick one-sitting read, where it is hard to tell where one poem ends and another begins. \n That said, there are individual poems in here which are gutting and transcendent in whatever format.

{"book_id":"2547","rating":5,"review_text":"BOOK REVIEW OF 'THE PROPHET' by KAHLIL GIBRAN: \n I had started reading The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran, thinking I should be able to finish it in a couple of days at the most; after all, it was only a slim book of 90 pages, with generously spaced lines and paragraphs plus a dozen or so full page illustrations. \n When I started to read, I had to stop frequently to catch the deeper meanings in those sentences. I read every chapter several times and within that, every sentence a couple of times. And I had to give myself breaks to take in as much as I could. Yes, it is philosophical, spiritual, some of it intensely metaphoric and some basic. \n Each sentence is worthy of being quoted, as they indeed have extensively been. Here's one quote from the chapter on Love: \"And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.\" Thus go many a memorable line in every chapter. \n The book begins with a chapter titled, The Coming of the Ship, where the Prophet is waiting for a ship to come and take him while the whole city gathers around him to bid farewell - A great metaphor for a wise man about to die. Then the folks ask him to share his wisdom before departing and in each chapter he shares his views on many life situations, 26 of them. Indeed each chapter is replete with wisdom spoken in metaphors and it takes some brooding to understand them. It took me some introspection and I am not sure if I got them correctly. The chapters are written as poetic essays or what is known as prose poetry. \n Kahlil Gibran was a Lebanese who migrated to America in 1895 when he was 12. He wrote both in Arabic and English. The Prophet was written in English and forms the first book of a trilogy of similar discourses on life and man's relationships with fellowmen, nature and God. It is the most notable of all his works and it took him 11 years to finalize. It has been translated into 40 languages and has sold 30 million copies. Gibran died at an early age of 48, having made his mark in classic literature. He was also a painter and sculptor. \n If you are bored with my review, here's another quote from Gibran on marriage: \"Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone, though they quiver with the same music.\" \n I have seen some not very encouraging reviews of the book. Perhaps, the writing is too didactic for some readers of today; some of us are not comfortable with preachy writings. But we need to give credit to Gibran for writing it some 100 years ago when the majority of the people were not as educated as they are today. Today almost everyone works out a smart quote and flashes it on their facebook, twitter or similar social network pages. \n The book ends with a chapter titled, Farewell, which symbolically denotes the death of the Prophet - he boards the ship waiting for him and sails away to the land he came from. According to Gibran death is not something to mourn, it is a new beginning: \"For life and death are one, even as the river and the seas are one.\" \n The final chapter effortlessly takes the reader back to the first chapter, going a full circle of life. The last sentence: \"A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me.\" \n Wow!","date":"2016-04-05"}

{"book_id":"12914","rating":3,"review_text":"The first half is better than the second - especially because after laboring through Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, we finally get to see the Trojan Horse and the fall of Troy. Virgil's style and narrative mirrors Homer's in many ways, but his themes and purpose were very different. The Aeneid was commissioned to celebrate the peace and might of the Roman empire under Augustus Caesar, and Rome's glorious past. And the poem can be read such - but it can also be read a critique of these very things. However, I don't think it was one or the other. Rome's power and prosperity enabled Virgil to write his poetry, and he recognizes this and the other ways Rome has benefited the world. However, he acknowledges that Rome's glory was bought with violence, war, death, and destruction. He accepts these as the price for greatness, but wonders if the cost was too high. Overall the poem is rather grim and fatalistic: throughout it is clear that the gods and humans cannot escape their destinies, or prevent those of others. Even Jupiter, king of the gods, must submit to the will of the fates. Thus the hero, Aeneas, is very different from his Homeric counterparts, Achilles and Odysseus. He does not seek fame or adventure, but is driven on by a destiny that obliterates his personhood. It is probably why, of all the heroes of epic poetry, he is the least admired and remembered.","date":"2017-09-03"}

I first read this in High School, and at the time I was unimpressed with the long-winded speeches on and off the battlefield; the repetitious descriptions of sacrifices, feasting, skirmishes, war equipment, and settings; and, most of all, the bickering among the gods (as much as I love classical mythology, the Greek pantheon is populated with some of the most irritating characters in all literature). Plus, I am not, and never have been a fan of war stories. Ten years later my opinion remains the much the same. I have more appreciation for the human drama in the narrative, and for the legacy that Homer bequeathed to later poets (Paradise Lost is one of my favorites, and Milton owes a lot to Homer). Still, it is an epic struggle to read. I like The Odyssey much better - largely because there are more fantasy elements, and the protagonist, Odysseus, is far more interesting and complex than Achilles or Hector. \n Note: I read Robert Fitzgerald's translation, but I didn't find it on Goodreads. It's an excellent translation, although I've heard Fagles' is good too.","date":"2017-08-10"}
{"book_id":"2696","rating":5,"review_text":"Chaucer is one of the most versatile writers I've ever read. Each story has its own distinct voice, as though a different writer wrote each one. He is equally adept at telling sumptuous tales of courtly love; raunchy, laugh-out-loud fabliaux; sobering sermons; and, enchanting fables. The Canterbury Tales is definitely deserving of its status as a classic. As this is a collection of stories told within a frame narrative, I will review each of the tales separately. \n Prologue: \n Probably the most famous catalog of characters in English literature, its reputation is well deserved. Chaucer represents people from all classes and professions of his time, and imbues each with a distinct and memorable personality. A group of travelers on the way to Canterbury stop at an inn. The innkeeper decides to go with them, and proposes a storytelling contest to entertain themselves along the way. \n The Knight's Tale: \n A true medieval romance, set in mythical Thebes and Athens. Two knights, Palamon and Arcite, fall in love with the beautiful Emelye. They become rivals, and the Duke Theseus declares that they shall compete in a tournament, the winner receiving Emily as a bride. Richly told and philosophically insightful, this story is the most satisfying of the tales in terms of narrative development, characterization, and thematic elements. As befits its teller, it has a loftier tone and nobler subject manner than many of the other tales, but it is no less entertaining. My guess is that this is the story that would have won the contest - or at least been in the top three - had it ever been completed. \n The Miller's Tale: \n A fabliaux staring a gullible old carpenter, his buxom young wife, a crafty student, and a lovelorn dandy. It is lewd and hilarious, with the funniest scene of ass kissing, flatulence, and ass branding ever written. \n The Reeve's Tale: \n Offended by the Miller's tale (because the Reeve was once a carpenter), the Reeve tells the story of a miller who swindles and humiliates two young clerks. The clerks, however, pay him back by sleeping with his wife and daughter. Like the Miller's tale, it highlights the animosity between the uneducated, but prosperous tradesmen, and learned, but poor scholars. But unlike the Miller's tale, it is not as entertaining or risque, and the characters are mean-spirited rather than mischievous. The Reeve succeeds in rebuking the Miller, but not in telling a better tale. \n The Cook's Tale: An incomplete tale that only lasts long enough to sketch the character of a dissolute apprentice who loves gambling, stealing, and carousing. \n The Lawyer's Tale: \n A sobering tale about maintaining faith in adversity and trusting to God's will during times of trail. The Princess Constance suffers many misfortunes, mostly at the hands of evil women. She endures it all with perfect Christian patience and piety. Some modern readers might say she is a doormat and too accepting of her fate. Overall the story lacks authentic characterization and dramatic tension. The didactic quality is also obvious: God punishes the wicked (eventually) and rewards the just (after much loss and trauma). \n This story also shows how Christianity is received differently by Islam and Pagans. The Muslims of Syria reject it, and kill the citizens that convert. The Pagans of England, however, gradually are converted to the religion. This reflect both real and imaginary historical facts, and also reveals the misconceptions that 13th century Europeans had about other religions, cultures, and their own past. \n The Sailor's Tale: \n The beautiful wife of a merchant and a lascivious monk agree to help each other obtain their desires. The monk will get a loan from her husband (who is thrifty with her) and give it to her; she, in turn, will sleep with him. They both get what they want, and when the husband finds out about it she promises to pay him back in bed, and he forgives her. There is not much to this tale (it's rather dull), except modern readers will note the gender inequality - particularly how the woman must manipulate the men in her life to get what she wants, rather than getting it for herself. Also notable is the worldliness of the monk. The luxurious and immoral lifestyle of the religious class appears in many of the tales, and Chaucer's distaste for them, though subtle, is evident. \n The Prioress's Tale: \n Jews murder an angelic Christian boy for singing a hymn to the Virgin Mary. The Jews and Christians are stereotyped and contrasted sharply: the Jews are malicious and violent, whereas the Christians are virtuous and blameless. The blatant anti-Semitism in this tale will shock modern readers. They will find the Prioress's romanticization of Christians to be frustrating; the Christians in her story are entirely faultless and saintly people - even the high-ranking clergy. But at one point, even she seems to recognize that this is not the reality: after praising the holy behavior of monks, she comments that what she has just said is \"at least how they ought to act\". \n Chaucer's Tales: \n Chaucer begins with a story about Sir Thopas, a knight who goes in search of the Elf Queen to marry her. The host interrupts him and says the story is nonsense and his poetic style doggerel. Chaucer proceeds to relate the tale of Melibeus; this is not so much a story as it is a philosophical treatise. When Melibeus is wronged by his enemies, his wife (Dame Prudence) advices him on how he should respond. The bulk of the narrative consists of this advice. It is well-argued, but is overly academic. Dame Prudence quotes the Bible and ancient Roman writers extensively to support her propositions. While her scholarly knowledge is impressive, it seems to be a cover for her lack of experience in the matters she is talking about. She expresses ideals that are theoretically sound and well-intentioned, but may not work in reality. This tale has little entertainment value, and leaves us wishing Chaucer would have gone back to his original tale of Sir Thopas. \n The Monk's Tale: \n Not so much a tale as a catalog of characters from history, mythology, and the bible. These men and women were all great, but their lives ended tragically. The purpose of the tale is to illustrate the uncertainty of life, and the vagaries of fate. Fortune is personified as a goddess - one day favoring a person, the next day discarding him. \n The Nun's Priest Tale: \n The priest relates a fable of Chanticleer, a vain cock with a beautiful singing voice. He dreams one night of a fox, but his wife dismisses dreams as nonsense. The fox comes, and captures Chanticleer through a trick. However, Chanticleer escapes through a trick and the story ends. Though a fable, it is more mature than Aesop's kind: the nature of dreams, and the mystery of determinism are both considered. \n The Physician's Tale: \n A corrupt judge uses his power to take the daughter of an esteemed knight for himself. The knight, to save his daughter's chastity, cuts off her head. Incited by this, and knowing the judge's character, the people revolt and execute the judge. As in other tales, Christian purity is under attack, but in this case a father must take extreme measures to preserve it. \n The Pardoner's Tale: \n Three ruffians go looking for Death, so they can kill him. Instead they find treasure. Immediately, each begins to plot against the others so he can have the treasure for himself. In the end, they do indeed find Death. More remarkable than his tale, is the Pardoner's unapologetic and brazen defense of his profession. He openly admits that he scams people, that his relics are fake, that he swindles the faithful through selling indulgences and pardons, that his piety is a sham, and that he only cares for money. No one, however, seems surprised by his honesty, although the host rebukes him harshly for it. \n The Wife of Bath's Tale: \n The prologue is more famous than the tale, and for good reason. The Wife extols the virtues of married life and of being a wife. This is contrasted with virginity, which the Wife says is a noble calling, but not for every woman, including herself. She has been married five times, and tells the travelers about each of her husbands. However, she makes it clear that she is the master of her body, her husband's, and their property. The Wife's feminism, confidence, intelligence, and candor are a refreshing departure from the other female characters (both in the company and the tales). Her tale is a variation of the \"Loathly Lady\" folktale, but with a theme that fits with her prologue. The moral is that men should submit to their wives, and be governed by them: this is the only way a marriage may be happy and the couple live in harmony. \n The Friar's Tale: \n The friar despises the Summoner, and so relates a tale of an avaricious Summoner who meets the devil and befriends him when they find how much they have in common. Unlike other tales dealing with immoral ecclesiastics, the criticism is open and hostile. The fact that it comes from a clergyman reveals the disdain that even those within the Church hierarchy had for their own henchmen. \n The Summoner's Tale: \n In retaliation to the Friar's tale, the Summoner tells of an unctuous, greedy friar who gets his comeuppance from a clever old man. Another story in which the clergy are censured for their rank hypocrisy, and in which flatulence plays a hilarious part. \n The Clerk's Tale: \n Like the Prioress's tale, modern readers will be offended by his story. The Clerk himself seems uncomfortable with it, explaining that he is only relating a tale he heard from someone else, and that he does not condone the actions of the characters in the story. Walter, a wealthy marquis, marries Griselda, a pious peasant girl. As a condition of their marriage, he makes her swear to submit to his will in everything without question or hesitation. She assents, but Walter decides to test her oath. \n And test it he does. His cruelties are repellant and repeatedly condemned by the narrator. But it is difficult to sympathize with Griselda: her emotionless and unquestioning acceptance of these injustices is inhuman. Modern readers, whether feminist or not, will be apoplectic with her mindless devotion to her husband as she utters no complaint when he takes away her children, divorces her for another woman, sends her back to a life of poverty, and makes her his new wife's servant. There is hardly anything heroic or virtuous about her Job-like patience, nor does the narrator encourage wives to imitate her. Indeed, he concludes the tale by admonishing wives to not let their husbands treat them as Walter did Griselda. \n The tale can be interpreted as an allegory for the Christian life. God will regularly test the love and devotion of his followers, and it is their duty to respond to these \"tests\" with humility and forbearance, submitting completely to God's will. But it is doubtful that such a reading will bring any spiritual consolation or insight to the faithful. It is more likely to raise troubling questions about God's nature. What does it say about God that he must constantly test his followers, or that his followers can never question his will? \n The Merchant's Tale: \n Another story in which an old husband is cuckolded by his pretty young wife and her youthful lover. The husband, though, is much more naive than the other husbands in previous tales. He entertains many idealized conceptions of marriage, and believes his wife is and will always be completely devoted to him. Throughout the tale, there are lively discussions about the pros and cons of marriage, the merits of ancient wisdom, and whether men or women are more faithful to their spouses. These friendly debates reach no certain conclusions. In the end, a supernatural intervention reveals the wife's infidelity. However, another power aids the wife, and she is able to trick her husband yet again. \n The Squire's Tale: \n Another unfinished tale, though more developed than the other. There are two complete parts, which establish a rich medieval fantasy realm with splendid castles, decadent feasts, talking animals, magical objects, and promises of adventure and romance. It is a shame this story was never finished, for the existing parts are so well written that it could easily have been one of the best tales. \n The Franklin's Tale: \n A lovesick squire pines after the wife of knight. The wife pities him, and says she will love him if he can perform as task that she believes is impossible. Through magic, the squire accomplishes the feat, and the wife must decide if she will keep her promise or not. In the end, everything works out for everyone involved. All the characters are virtuous and compassionate, and are rewarded for being so. There is a cosmic reciprocity at work (karma if you will, although that seems anachronistic in Chaucer) - that is, mercy is shown to the merciful and generosity to the generous. This is probably the most uplifting of the tales. \n The Second Nun's Tale: \n The second nun warns the travelers about the dangers of idleness, and proceeds to relate the life of St. Cecilia. This is a standard hagiography, where supernatural occurrences and martyrdom are commonplace. As might be expected, the nun emphasizes that spiritual purity and bodily chastity are synonymous (and the preferred and most perfect form of chastity is virginity) and that if chastity is lost, so is purity. \n The Canon's Yoeman's Tale: \n A cautionary tale about alchemy. The yeoman has been ruined by his pursuit of alchemy and its false promise of the Philosopher's Stone. He laments his misfortune, and describes how alchemists swindle simple people of their money. The pseudo-science of alchemy is fascinating (and, however erroneous, was the precursor to modern chemistry), and it is easy to see its appeal. \n The Manciple's Tale: \n Another cautionary tale, this time warning against being an informant. The Manciple relates a contemporary version of Ovid's myth of Coronis. The Manciple advises the travelers to speak prudently, and avoid being a talebearer. Even if you know that your friend's spouse is an adulterer, it is better not to tell. \n The Parson's tale: \n Not a tale, but a lengthy sermon. The Parson describes a variety of sins and how to avoid them by practicing their opposing virtues. He urges them to do penance for their sins, and to strive to live a holy life. Though puritanical in nature, the tone is sincere and pastoral: the parson genuinely cares for the spiritual well-being of his listeners. This is not a hellfire harangue like \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\". Doubtless the religious travelers found it edifying, but most of the company probably would wish he actually told a story and left the preaching for the church pulpit. \n The Conclusion: \n Chaucer hastily closes the frame narrative by apologizing to his readers for any offence he may have given them. He hopes there is something of value in the tales, but if not, to forgive him. Unfortunately, he does not tell us who won the contest or whether or not the travelers reached Canterbury.","date":"2016-11-04"}

{"book_id":"676","rating":2,"review_text":"Too sappy and dramatic for my taste \n Collins's poems are imaginative and enjoyable but there is an overwritten/over-poeticized quality to them that kept me from connecting to the poems. \n Collins uses words like \"wondrous,\" \"melancholy,\" \"misery,\" and \"beautiful.\" These words in a poem are overkill, in my opinion. Words like these weigh a poem down, making the poem feel too sentimental or melodramatic. For example, Collins describes the moon as a \"pale bachelor, well-groomed and full of melonchony\" in his poem \"The Man in the Moon.\" This description of the moon is imaginative, but to me the image feels dramatic and corny. It's overemotional and sappy in a way that I find annoying. \n Collins has an amazing mind and creates poems that flow well and contain vivid imaginative images, but the poems don't quite work for me.

{"book_id":"5932","rating":1,"review_text":"I just couldn't understand them. I wish I could reach the level of some of the other reviewers who disliked his objectification of women, but I couldn't find any meaning to almost all of these poems to begin with: too many unclear metaphors and fragmented lines that, unlike pretentious critics would have you believe, is not an indication of the poet's mood, but rather his lack of something to say or the inability to say it clearly . \n See how elegant Ezra Pound's advice to poets is: \n \"Use no superfluous word, no adjective, which does not reveal something. \n Don't use such an expression as \"dim lands of peace.\" It dulls the image. It mixes an abstraction with the concrete. It comes from the writer's not realizing that the natural object is always the adequate symbol. \n Go in fear of abstractions. Don't retell in mediocre verse what has already been done in good prose. Don't think any intelligent person is going to be deceived when you try to shirk all the difficulties of the unspeakably difficult art of good prose by chopping your composition into line lengths\". \n Neruda's work here is a typical example of what Pound was arguing against: Too many superfluous words, dull images, and mediocre verse filled with abstractions.","date":"2017-03-17"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"Normally I don't like poetry. Most of the poetry that I've read is descriptive and the kind of writing that I would describe as \"fluff\". If there is a underlying deeper meaning it lies under too many metaphors and descriptions to be easily found. This book of poetry is the exact opposite. The deeper meaning is immediately seen and the descriptions that used only serve to highlight that meaning. \n The book tells a story of trauma and rediscovery. It's a short book that is told in four sections: the hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing. The hurting tells the short of a girl growing up and the things that young girls learn to feel about themselves. In the loving, life seems happier. She is happily in love, in the bliss of the beginning of love. Then in the breaking, she tells how that all falls away. How the loving that she felt in the previous section is broken apart and the hurting feelings come back into play. The healing takes the time to look at each of the previous sections, mulling through all of those feelings. In the end she has worked through those feelings and learned to love herslf. \n The power of Rupi Kaur's words lies in the feelings that she evokes. There are so many lines and images in her poetry that you instantly connect with. Your experience may not have been the same but you identify with the feelings she describes. The feeling that so many girls have when they realize what the world thinks they are worth. The feeling of complete blind happiness when you fall in love, followed by what feels like world shattering when you realize that life is not as perfect as you thought. But the last section, the healing, where she describes putting herself back together, discovering who she is, and learning to love herself is what really made this book powerful for me. \n This is a book that I would recommend everyone to read. Every person can feel a connection with her words. Her words are not overly descriptive or beautiful, but raw and emotional. The type of words that gives you a very honest look at her world, and hopefully your own.","date":"2016-12-30"}

To fight the pain, to let this moment get through, to let this day pass by and to forget everything that we're losing ourselves, piece by piece. \n Enough words \n can save \n thousands of \n souls. \n Even though, I admit, the author just makes a sentence and then separate those words by 'enter' to make a poem, it still sounds so good.

So to read books in order to wide one's horizons is just to sign a pact with the devil. \n \"Pillowed on evil, Satan Trismegist \n Ceaselessly cradles our enchanted mind, \n The flawless metal of our will we find \n Volatilized by this rare alchemist. \n The Devil holds the puppet threads; and swayed \n By noisome things and their repugnant spell, \n Daily we take one further step toward Hell, \n Suffering no horror in the olid shade.\" \n And of course the poets, who manage to pack their words in the most seductive opuses, are the worst of tempters... \n \"When by an edict of the powers supreme \n A poet's born into this world's drab space, \n His mother starts, in horror, to blaspheme \n Clenching her fists at God, who grants her grace.\" \n So when the poet unsheathes his stylus and applies it to vellum the flowers of evil effloresce. Such are the poet's morose ideals: \n \"What my heart, deep as an abyss, demands, \n Lady Macbeth, is your brave bloody hands, \n And, Aeschylus, your dreams of rage and fright, \n Or you, vast Night, daughter of Angelo's, \n Who peacefully twist into a strange pose \n Charms fashioned for a Titan's mouth to bite.\" \n But when poets die their poems live... \n \"Then, O my beauty, tell the insatiate worm \n Who wastes you with his kiss, \n I have kept the godlike essence and the form \n Of perishable bliss!\"","date":"2016-07-11"}

When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will reach the fertile shore of Proserpine's country with its groves of tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark abode of Hades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring rivers run into one another. \n \"When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a drink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine, and in the third place water - sprinkling white barley meal over the whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble ghosts, and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load the pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that Teiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all your flocks.\" \n And all ends here. \n \"As the end approaches, there are no longer any images from memory - there are only words.

It's Shakespeare so of course it's going to be a tad difficult to understand, but if you have a translation it helps tremendously! And I'll admit that it was a great story. The plot was pretty brilliant when you look at it and the sassiness of Hamlet made me laugh on several occasions. He's exactly how you would expect an angsty teenager to act. Seriously I would recommend this just based on Hamlet's retorts. Once you understand them they're pretty clever . I loved Shakespeare's puns and humor that lightened up the tragedy of the play. \n Of course Hamlet is pretty shady and I feel so bad for all the characters who get dragged into the mess that Claudius created. The whole thing is spurred by the revenge Hamlet must get for his father and as someone who hates the idea of revenge, this play did have me hating the protagonist (seriously revenge is never the answer). \n In the end almost everyone ends up dead and you find yourself thinking, \"Well that certainly was bloody (reminds me a bit of Romeo and Juliet tbh). But the plot was still amazing. Plus you can see where Shakespeare coins some of our more common phrases such as \"Be true to yourself\". \n In short whilst I did enjoy the plot, the Shakespearean language is a tad difficult to drag yourself through and ALL THE DEATHS like really Shakespeare.

{"book_id":"19351","rating":4,"review_text":"You were given the kingship, such was your destiny, everlasting life was not your destiny. \n This is basically about a guy who's got all the attributes of godhood except immortality. So even though he's all fabulous, and he's got all this enormous power, and he's better at everyone else than everything, none of it's gonna save him from the reality of death. \n His awareness of this fact seems to loom over him increasingly as the story progresses, much like it might through out a regular person's life. Early on he's obsessed with making his mark on the world: living a life so legendary that no one will forget him, and he will be immortal in the memory of mankind. He ends up causing so much mischief that the deities that created him end up having to create a brother just so he has someone who can keep up with him. \n I really enjoyed the origin story for Gilgamesh's brother Enkidu, where they have this sort of 'taming the savage' which struck me as funny for some reason. I also loved they dynamic between them. Gilgamesh is really cultured (for the time he lived in) and Enkidu is friggin #SAVAGE \n Gilgamesh: Gee this guy just surrendered and gave us everything he owns, it kinda takes the fun out of killing him. Do you think we should, you know, let him go? \n Enkidu: No. \n Gilgamesh: But there's no glory in that. \n Enkidu: Kill now, glory later... \n And then his brother dies and on top of the supreme personal loss, Gilgamesh has to deal with his unresolved latent fear of the finality death. \n And he goes on this journey to the land of the gods to discover why. I was surprised at how eloquent some of his musings are, though it's told through what I would consider a pretty worldly perspective, it doesn't diminish or dismiss the reality of it or what he's going through! \n Ultimately there are things people can do to postpone the inevitable, but you can't escape fate. The joy of life isn't in escaping death, or even in leaving of a legacy: The joy in life is in living it. Living in the now, and making the most of every moment. \n This is, like, one of the first books ever and it gets pretty friggin deep!","date":"2017-07-20"}
{"book_id":"2696","rating":4,"review_text":"I didn't read the stories in order because I listened to the Knight's Tale 3 times and I still don't understand what it's about. I'm just gonna add little synopses and thoughts as I complete the stories. \n *Warning: Spoilers Below* \n These Dudes and Dudettes from various walks of life are all traveling on a road together, and they're all going to the same place (Canterbury). So they make themselves company and to make the time pass more pleasantly they decide to tell each other stories as they camp out. (I imagine they're by a fire or something, though for how long this book is they probably told stories throughout the day as well). \n The Franklin- \n Honestly I didn't know that a \"Franklin\" was an actual job title, but it's apparently a guy who owns land in the medieval times but he's still not a nobleman. His story was a romantic-ish one about this knight who's awesome and who gets married to this girl who's awesome, and everything is fine for a while except that the knight's squire is the girl's bff and is also in love with her. One time while the knight is away he makes his move and the Knight's Wife is all \"Eww!\" \n But then she thinks about it and goes: \"You know what, squire? I feel bad for you, and you're my friend so I'll give you a chance: if you can take all the rocks off of this landscape (I forget, I think it was a beach) I'll sleep with you.\" \n Now, I'm gonna assume she was just trying to let him down easy, BUT IT DOESN'T WORK! Because after wallowing in self pity for a while and crashing at his brother's house, the squire meets up with a clerk-dude who's actually secretly a magician and he pays the magician to remove the rocks. \n Then he goes back to the Knight's wife and says, \"K, I did the thing now be mine...\" And she feels really bad cuz she really loves her husband. She goes through this whole laundry list of women who have killed themselves rather than be raped. Just example after example, it actually gets a bit annoying after a while. \n Finally she admits to her husband what she promised to the squire guy and he's not mad at her for being so stupid, and he's not mad at the other guy for wanting his wife. He's just sad and he just basically says, \"Go do what you gotta do.\" \n So when she finally goes to the Squire guy's house and he sees how miserable she is he's like \"Ugh, Fine I'm actually not that big a duchebag. You can go back to your husband.\" \n Then the squire goes to the magician dude, and tells him all what happened, and the magician dude feels so bad for him he forgives him his debt. \n Basically everything worked out pretty well for everyone involved; I have the feeling Mr Franklin is a sucker for happy endings. \n The really interesting thing about this story to me is that the storyteller repeatedly reminds you that the husband and wife actually, genuinely love and respect each other as if that's something unique to this particular couple. \n Also, the characters are understanding and compassionate towards each other. There's no \"pound of flesh\" in this story, and everyone has a chance to make what's wrong right again. \n The Doctor- \n This one was pretty weird. \n A corrupt government official wants the daughter of this guy and has this scheme to get her. Her dad goes home to tell her what's going on and they mutually decide that she should die rather than go into this evil guy's clutches. So she lets him cut her head off. \n Weird, huh? \n The Pardoner- \n I've read this story before, and I like it a lot. But this time I payed more attention to the prelude to the story. All of these stories have a prelude that kind of introduces the character telling the story and has a bit of interaction between the group members. In this one, the pardoner basically admits he's a hypocrite/schemer. He's selling a product and he's going to show us the tool of his trade. Then he starts this fantastic story about theses three young men who set out to kill death and end up killing each other. \n The storyteller ends the story by asking for alms and money for their confessions. I assume he's saying it sarcastically. \n His story reminds me a lot of the Tale of the Three Brothers in the last Harry Potter book. I'm pretty sure JK Rowling was inspired by this story. Both are about discovering that death isn't actually the adversary we tend to think it is. \n The Reeve- \n I looked it up and a reeve is a manager or boss for serfs. Sometimes he's appointed by the lord, and sometimes he's elected by the serfs. \n Anyway the reeve's name is Oswald, and he tells a story about a corrupt miller who takes advantage of these two dudes, and then the dudes get revenge against him and his family. \n The Friar-Its about his crooked lawyer guy who meets this other guy on the road and they're like crook soulmates. They swear to be forever besties and then the other guy admits he is actually a demon (a literal demon, as in from hell) and shares with him the tricks of his trade. \n I guess it was a bit moralizing towards the end, because in the next chapter the Knight doesn't like it. (I liked it though) \n The Nun's Priest-A widow who is very successful, healthy and happy also has a chicken rooster who is successful, healthy and happy. However he starts having dreams and premonitions about his impending death and when he tells his number one hen about them she makes fun of him. So he stops talking about it until he gets another one but still ends up not doing anything about it. \n Eventually he meets with a very charming and flattering fox. Even though the fox is the exact same color as the thing that kills him in his dream, the roster is taken in by the fox and is killed by him. The widow and her daughters get really mad that their rooster is dead and kill the fox. \n (Side Note: I have this headcannon that the reason everyone speaks in rhyme is that their storytelling is a competition and one of the rules is that everyone has to speak in rhyme; some of the storytellers are better at it than others.) \n The Lawyer- \n At the beginning he prefaces the story by saying he wants to tell a non-perverted romance story. It's about a princess who is promised to marry a far-away king. And she's obviously really unhappy about leaving everything she's ever known to go into this forgine land with strange people to wed a guy she doesn't know. \n But it turns out that the guy is actually pretty nice (it's his mom you have to worry about). The king wants to become a Christian, so he chose a wife from a christian country. His mom is super pissed about this and acts nice to the princess when she gets there, but basically just ruins her life. \n The princess goes through a lot of peril and has adventures (and a baby boy), and miraculously she stays alive and finds her husband again. They're able to live happily together, and she even goes to her home country and sees her parents again. \n I thought it was interesting that the story points out that the husband didn't live a really long time after finding his wife again, but that he lived happily because he found her. It's not so much the length of life as much as the quality of one's life that matters. \n The Wife- \n I started listening to this a couple of times before I realized I've heard this one before! It has the base story for \"Sir Gawain and the Loathly Lady\" (even though the knight is not specified to be Sir Gawain in the wife's story, apparently people attribute it to him because he was such a womanizer and it's interesting to see him being taken down a notch by the women in his life) \n Other than the Loathly Lady portion, a lot of the wife's tale involves stories from her own life. She prefaces the stories by staying she doesn't mean to offend any of the guys in the company (the company is mostly guys I think) Especially the Clerks...because she's been married to a few of them. \n I really like this one because it gives perspective on how a woman in the middle ages might view life and relationships. Normally I think I'd find the wife really annoying, but in this story I just think she's really funny. An unabashedly horny gossip. \n (Side note: I think it's interesting she's called a wife even though it doesn't seem like she's currently married, just because she's been married a lot of times and out lived her husbands) \n The Cook-This one is really short, and it seems like most if it is just the host complaining about how cooks sell rotten or out-of-date food. The story is about a good-for-nothing apprentice who is eventually fired and has to find his own way in life. \n The Shipman-There's this woman who's married to this rich guy but he doesn't give her enough spending money. So she complains to his friend who happens to be a Monk or something, and she goes \"I know he's your best friend but...\" Then the monk corrects her: \"Oh, no!\" He says, \"Actually, you're my best friend. He's nice, but I just hang out with him so I can be around you.\" Together they hatch a plan to get the wife her spending money. \n Sir Thopas' Tale- I'm not really sure who's telling this story, but it's about a handsome guy who wants to marry an elf. I'm not even sure what ends up happening, it's not that long though. \n The Prioress-Jews are evil and kill Christians who sing songs, but can't stop them from singing praises even after they are dead. \n The Monk-In this story we learn about Queen Zenobia. I first learned about her on kickstarter https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/... so it was neat to learn a bit more. Sounds like she was pretty brutal! I'm gonna have'ta read a real history book on her sometime. \n Also has this pretty cool quote: \"Full wise is he who can himself know.\" Kind of obvious, but I liked it. \n The Canon's Yeoman-I think the canon is a priest but it's a Yeoman (servant) who tells the story. It's about an alchemist-troll who pretends to have discovered the philosopher's stone but is actually a scammer. \n The Sompenour- \n Anal. And Farts. That's about it. \n The Second Nun- \n I listened to this about three times, all I can remember is it's about a girl who has to get married but wants to not have sex, and she becomes a saint at the end. \n Meliboeus- \n It's about a guy and he get's wronged in some way and he's mad and he has to deal with it but he's really angry and prone to rash action, so he checks behavior with his wife (Who is appropriately named Prudence) and she is basically his voice of reason through the whole ordeal. \n The Clerk- \n The story is about a lord or king named Walter who's people want him to get married. He makes them a deal: they pick the date, he picks the girl. He even has a girl in mind (I don't remember her name, except it starts with G, and apparently he's had a crush on her for forever). So he does the proper courtly thing and ask's G's dad for her hand. And then he asks G herself, with the prenup that she will have to bear whatever he puts her through without ever complaining or even looking like she's sad or disappointed. For some stupid reason, she agrees. \n So everything's fine until they have their first child (a girl) and as soon as she's weaned Walter says the people are unhappy because it's not a boy, so their daughter must be 'gotten rid of'... So like, \"Go say goodbye, G...\" \n G makes one request...that their daughter won't die in pain, and that she will be buried respectfully, but she never shows any anger, sadness or disappointment to her husband (thus, honoring her prenup). \n Unbeknownst to G, Walter has daughter taken to his sister (who is a duchess)'s house, where she is to be raised respectfully, but not knowing her heritage. \n Some years later, Walter and G have another kid: this time it's a boy. And when the child is two years old he pulls the same crap all over again. Just like the first time, his wife falls for it and keeps their prenup. \n A few more years pass, but Walter and G don't have any more kids. (hmm. wonder why?) and G is always happy and obedient around her husband. Then Walter pulls his last test: telling G she's no longer a suitable wife, he's obtained a divorce and he will be marrying a new wife. \n G is still not angry at him, she tells him everything in her life belongs to him and she will go back to live with her dad. But first, Walt wants her to act as lady-in-waiting to his new bride: a twelve year old kid. \n When she finally does this, he reveals that his \"Bride\" is actually their firstborn, and her escort is her brother (their son). That he's been testing her fidelity their whole lives together, and they can now live happily ever after together as a family, until Walter finally dies. \n (^^^Thank freaking goodness!) \n Even though the Clerk says he doesn't condone Walter's actions in putting his wife to the test, it's pretty clear that G putting up with her husband's crap was her greatest virtue. I'm also pretty sure the Clerk has some unfulfilled dominance/submission fantasies. \n The Clerk- \n This one was pretty confusing. It's about a king and his two sons he also has a daughter I think. Someone comes and brings them gifts and then I'm completely lost. Seriously, I listened to it 4 times and I still can't make sense of it. It just seems like rambling. \n Eventually the Franklin cuts in and starts his own monologue, leading into his own story. \n The Manciple- \n I learned a manciple is a guy who buys food for monks who live in monasteries, or students who live in universities and don't get out much. \n The story is about this knight guy, they call him a bachelor at the start but he's actually married and he has a pet crow with pure white feathers. The crow kind of acts like Odin's ravens: it can talk and it tells him what's going on when he's not around. \n One day it tells him his wife is cheating on him, and he is so angry he goes home and kills his wife in a fit of rage. Later on he really regrets it. He plucks all the pure white feathers from the crow and replaces them with inky black ones, and takes away his ability to speak. \n \"Caw, Caw\" \n The moral of the story basically amounts to \"Always tell the truth, but don't be always telling it\" \n I think it's weird that knight guy would own a bird for that particular purpose, and then get mad when it DOES IT'S FRIGGIN JOB!!! \n Sorry, Knight dude, this one's on you... \n The story did have some interesting quotes though. My favorite goes \"He is his thrall to whom a fellow's told a tale.\" \n The Merchant- \n The merchant starts out by talking about how his wife is a prude, and then the host asks him to tell at tale. \n His story is about a guy who's kind of been a man-whore his whole life and then he gets old and decides it's time to settle down. It goes on for quite a while about how idealistic this guy is about the marital state. \n Anyway, he ends up with this really young lady and it turns out she's as horny as a tumbleweed and wants to have sex all the time and everywhere. He can't give it too her cuz he's old and gets tired...but the guy has a younger servant who's up for the job. \n One day his wife tricks him but he catches her, but because he's old and he has bad eyesight she's able to convince him he didn't see anything. \n The Knight- \n Listened to it at least 3 more times and here's what I got: \n There's a duke who's this great warrior and won a lot of city/states for his country. The most recent one was won when he ended up marrying the queen of the city/state, Hippolyta. So the Duke is coming home with his new wife and his wife's sister, Emily (but spelled weird). \n On the road leading up to his house there are a bunch of weeping women in the roadway and the Duke is all like, \"WTF, are you guys trying to ruin my honeymoon?\" and the ladies are all like, \"No. We're just upset because we're the wives of your soldiers who died, and the guy in charge of the mortuary won't release the bodies to us.\" And the Duke goes, \"Well that's totally messed up! Hold on, let me go and fix this!\" So he sends his wife and sister-in-law to the house, but he goes and solves this problem for the widows. \n In doing so, he gains these two knights who are like brothers-in-arms to his service and ends up bringing them home. Problems arise when both of the knights-dudes fall in love with the same girl: \n Emily, Hippolyta's sister. \n (Well thank goodness it's not the Duke's wife, huh?) \n The rest of the story is basically \"Brethren or wenches?\" as the two knights try to navigate courtly courtship without stepping on each others toes. Eventually, though things come to a head and they have to appeal to the Duke to find a solution to who is worthy to be Emily's partner. \n In part two, we get Emily's perspective as she prays to her patron deity (Diana) asking if she can please stay single, because he doesn't really care to get married, or if she does have to get married that she'll end up getting the better man. Diana gets back to her and tells her that unfortunately, yeah she has to get married but don't worry she's going to work it out so everything works out best for Emily. \n Her suitors also pray to their patron deities (Mars and Venus respectively), and the two knights go in a fight. Stuff happens and one of them dies. But in a sweet way, in his favored lady's arms. He even ends up blessing her union to the other man, so I guess everything worked out. \n The Parson- \n It's not a story. I kept waiting for it to turn into a story, because a lot of the stories start with an introduction kinda like this and then the story starts. But the parson is just basically saying \"Ya'll need to get right with God\" after listening to them going on all day. \n After this \"Tale\" Chaucer signs off. \n I think that concludes The Canterbury Tales for me. The thing that surprised me the most is that, even though the language is antiquated, the perspectives of the characters aren't. I often have this idea that the people of long ago were, like, all oppressed and subjugated and brainwashed but then there's Chaucer poking fun at guys who are misogynistic and making potty jokes and stupid sexual innuendos, and it's like \"Yup, 500+ years and we haven't changed.\" Society may have been really messed up, but people in their hearts probably weren't that different from the \"liberated\" people of today. \n That being said, it was the dialect made it really hard to get through. Even though I've listened to many of the stories before this reading, I didn't recognize them. (Most humiliatingly, with The Knight's Tale...I didn't remember the story until Emily started praying to Diana on my last attempt at reading SMH). I'm sure there's still a lot of the stories I'm missing so I highly recommend that this book be read in an edition with historical/literary commentary and footnotes. I think it would make it a whole lot easier and more enjoyable.","date":"2016-10-20"}
{"book_id":"3049","rating":4,"review_text":"I listened to the Lewis translation. \n This was an impulsive read for me. A book I'm reading gave a little teaser of one of the main scenes, and the premise just seemed so delightful I had to find out more about it right away. \n To me, the story feels modern. Like it's something someone would think up as a parody of the Knights of the Round Table. But then, the only other tale from Arthurean Legend I'm very familiar with is \"Sir Gawain and the Loathly Lady\" (Which I thought was a parody too.) But maybe they're all like that... \n (Sir Gawain has quite an interesting love live btw) \n The story starts out with Sir Gawain and how he's fallen in love with this girl named Lady Elfinhart. Then one day, a Green Knight shows up at one of their court parties and says \"I dare y'all to try and cut my head off!\" (Note: the preceding quote has been paraphrased) But all the time he's smirking and making eyes at Lady Elfinhart and she's returning the look like they know each other and have some sort of understanding. Well, Gawain can't have someone looking at the girl he likes like that so he takes him up on the offer and tries to cut his head off with his sword. It doesn't work. Then the green knight tells him, \"K, in one year. You have to meet me and it'll be my turn to cut your head off.\" \n The rest of the story proceeds as you might expect for a story about knights and damsels, but the funnest part was Lady Elfinhart's backstory. Nevermind, that her name pretty much gives it away She's a human, raised by elves I still thought the whole premise was a lot of fun. \n http://portsherry.com/comics/helping-...","date":"2016-08-26"}
{"book_id":"1420","rating":2,"review_text":"From the synopsis, it seems like this story would be really exciting, but it's not really exciting. Everyone really focuses on the fact that Hamlet sees his dad's ghost and finds out about this conspiracy and that kind of drives him crazy. I'm not convinced that's what happened. \n Hamlet is a school kid and he's just come home because his dad died a few months ago and his mom abruptly married his uncle. He's already resentful and suspicious of them. Then the nightwatchmen tell him about this specter they see at midnight. \n It's not just Hamlet who's dealing with change in his life; his whole country is in the middle of a huge transition with a different king, uses a different leadership style...it's a period of adjustment for everyone and these guys who work in the dark at night think they see what looks like their former king all decked out in his warlord-glory. \n But because this ghost never does anything other than just stand there and look cool (and also because they're clearly spinning tales), no one will believe what they've seen. So they have to work up a dude who has some intellectual legitimacy to get up in the middle of the night, go out and check it out. \n It may be just me, but it totally seems like they're leading him on: \n \"OH-EM-Ghee did you see that?\" \n \"It totally looks like the dead king!\" \n (Note: the above passage has been paraphrased.) \n Then they get Hamlet, the excitable schoolkid whose dad just died and who is probably already suspicious of foul-play, out there in the middle of the dark at night and tell him to look for a ghost. What else could have possibly happened? \n Don't get me wrong, the first part of the story is arguably the most exciting. We as readers get to decide whether there really was a murder, whether Hamlet is insane, or whether there is yet another conspiracy going on. \n Except that nothing really significant happens after that, apart from Mr Shakespeare basically using the rest of the story to showcase his wordplay. There aren't any plot twists, and character development is minimal, really. Hamlet starts out as this kid fresh from school who doesn't know how to make any real world decisions and I really felt like that was true at the end of the story as well. He doesn't expose his uncle, he doesn't get right with his girlfriend. He just does these passive-aggressive little attacks kind of hinting that he knows something more than he's supposed to that damage his credibility and alienate the people who could help him. \n He just continues to live in the shadows of people like his dad and his uncle who actually get stuff done. \n Which I suppose is supposed to be the point, it's kind of an anti-coming of age story, but I don't think it's very exciting. \n Note: \n Horatio should be the new king.","date":"2016-04-13"}
{"book_id":"15645","rating":2,"review_text":"For some reason I was expecting this to be like \"The Pilgram's Progres\" where everything's symbolic and has a moral meaning to it. This book is more like a social commentary about things that happened a really long time ago that I know very little about. \n It's about this guy who get's lost in the woods one day and gets rescued by this a dead poet and in order to get him back to his normal life he has to ascend through the various realms of the afterlife. Along his journey he gets the grand circle tour of hell and meets a lot of mythic and socieo-political figures of his day. \n Mr Alighieri's vision of hell is heavily inspired by christian and greek theology and it's pretty psychadelic. There's a parade of monsters and settings, and comparitively few of them were able to leave an impression on me. \n The funniest part was when Dante met with this guy who he really really hates (I don't think he names him, but it's clear he had someone particular in mind). And the guy who he really really hates says something like, \"I told you I'd see you in hell!\" And then Dante's like, \"Yeah, well at least I don't live here! :P\" \n One thing that particularly made this enjoyable was that I listened to the dramatic reading on librivox, and I really liked the people who did the voices. \n I recommend this to people who are familiar with greek/roman mythology and early italian history (Middle ages)","date":"2016-02-20"}
{"book_id":"15997","rating":4,"review_text":"It's tricky to review this book - a decision needs to be made as to whether you are reviewing Milton's epic poem or Fowler's huge set of notes that go with it. \n I started trying to read Fowler's notes but soon gave up. They are probably of fantastic assistance to the academic, but for the casual reader like me it just destroyed the flow of reading. So in the end I stuck with just Milton and apart from looking up odd references I simply slowly read it end to end. \n It's a surprisingly approachable read for something written in 1667. Milton may have been a master of weaving in a million and one allusions to the bible and other literature - but mostly you can follow the poem, even if you probably don't appreciate its full richness, without knowing these. \n It's taken me a long time to finish, dipping in and out over weeks and perhaps a speedier more consistent reading pattern may have improved my enjoyment. \n Footnote: for anyone confused about my reference to Fowler's notes, I actually read the Routledge edition, not the penguin one in the picture. But when I used that ISBN it brought me to this one. The Penguin and Routledge editions are substantially different - not in the actual poem but in the addition of Fowler's large amount of additional information. However, I suspect of interest to the academic or very serious reader only.","date":"2017-03-27"}

It is easy to read and you don't need to search for the meaning in every poem - it's right there, plain and simple. \n Jacqueline Woodson tells the story of her childhood, her birth in Ohio and her early years in South Carolina and later in New York City. It is a interesting tale in itself, and her writing makes it beautiful. She talks about family, about friendship and about her dream of a future as a writer. \n It was an enjoyable, quick read filled with emotions.

{"book_id":"1420","rating":5,"review_text":"I loved Hamlet, because it's one of those rare Shakespeare plays which is easy to follow, despite the occasionally difficulty of the language. I've also been lucky enough to see a performance of this at The Globe in London, which was exceptional - as much as I like to read Shakespeare's plays, you can't beat seeing a live performance. \n Hamlet is a classic tale of murder and intrigue, centring on the titular character, a Danish prince. As you can probably imagine, a Danish prince in a Shakespeare play is in for a tough old time - there's plenty of treachery and subterfuge, and Hamlet himself makes for an awesome protagonist. \n Overall, I'd easily put this up there in my top three Shakespeare plays, and I'd recommend it if you like his work. He's arguably the most influential writer who's ever lived, and this is one of his many masterpieces - you should read it for research, if nothing else. Even better, if you get a chance to see a performance then do that, but read the play first.","date":"2016-04-24"}
{"book_id":"31426","rating":4,"review_text":"Sylvia Plath was one hell of a writer, and, similarly to how I feel about Charles Bukowski, I always preferred her poetry to her prose. I'll freely admit that both are very good, but I think that her natural way with words just lends itself to poetry, because she can make words sing to you from a page. \n This particular book \"contains all Sylvia Plath's mature poetry written from 1956 up to her death in 1963.\" Let's not talk about her death, because it's sad to talk about and raises all sorts of other questions, and focus on her life and her work instead, because let me tell you, there's a lot here for you to enjoy. \n In fact, there's so much poetry here that it's hard for me to identify particular poems which stood out, because they all did in their way. I'd say that there's perhaps a couple of hundred poems included in here, and so it's not like you're spoiled for choice. The fact that they're divided by year does, however, serve an important purpose - it gives you a feeling of accomplishment as you make your way through the pages, which you might otherwise be missing if it was just poem after poem after poem, with no section breaks. \n Ultimately, this collection of poetry is the kind of thing that you'd probably enjoy if you're a fan of the classics but if you never got into poetry - Plath isn't necessarily a traditional poet, but she's not avante garde either, and so her work is pretty accessible even to the modern reader who's picking up the collection over fifty years after her death. \n My only problem with this book is the fact that, because it contains all of the work written up to her death, there's never going to be another one for me to read. Still, it's the kind of book that you can read again and again, so do yourself a favour and add it to your collection.","date":"2016-04-15"}

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":5,"review_text":"This fairly short collection of poetry completely blew me away. Inspired by my postcolonial theory class and discussions of race in America, I started to look for books that would give me a chance to put into use what I learned during that course, and came across Claudia Rankine's Citizen. My local library surprisingly had this in their collection, of which I am extremely happy, because I don't think an e-copy of this would have done justice to the way this book is not only written, but also put together through inclusion of images etc. \n I am a white, middle class, educated young woman from Finland. I grew up in a place where like 99.9 % of people were white and middle class, and never really had to think about issues related to race while growing up. I was 11 when I first traveled abroad, but it was to one of those places where most of the people were tourists who looked exactly like me. It wasn't until my exchange student year to United States at the age of 16 that I really became conscious of the issues related to race and racism. I traveled from Finland to Washington D.C. and was picked up by a family of Mexican immigrants - a wonderful group of people who offered me their home for 10 months and very quickly became like a family to me. The cultural differences were embraced at the home setting, but when I went to school and started to spend time with the family outside the home-setting, questions started to arise. Very quickly, I came face to face with situations in which I was seen as the superior due to my skin color. I was shocked - I was a quest in that country, but still some people seemed to treat me like I had more of a right to be in there than the people who had taken me in. I am grateful for my year in US, because it opened my eyes up for so many things I probably would not have become aware of in Finland, at least not at that age. Now, questions of race are becoming more and more in-bedded into our national discussions, and the perspectives I learned in US have really helped me to form my opinions about the issues in Finland right now. \n Rankine's collection focuses on different kind of racial encounters and aggressions in media as well as in daily life; the slips of the tongue, the questions of \"is that racist\", the representations of athletes, etc. It also pays quite extensively attention to race and issues of safety and for those who have been following the evolution of the Black Lives Matter movement, there's definitely a lot of food for thought here. \n This book really made me think about my own privilege, and the privilege of people around me. The way Rankine delves into the matter of everyday racism, the little slips of tongue that some people do without realizing that what they are saying might be hurtful, is done very powerfully and in a way that makes you think about your own actions and own words. Though this book is very much tied to US context, I think the message of it is universal. And since what happens in US is often felt around the world in other countries, understanding of the US society is crucial. This book can help you with that, by offering a very interesting, vivid image of racism in our contemporary, \"post-race\" society. \n If you get a chance to pick this one up, I highly recommend you do so!","date":"2016-02-21"}

{"book_id":"27494","rating":3,"review_text":"I read an article recently by a book reviewer about how she does her job, and basically she views her columns as describing her experience of reading the book rather than criticizing it, so I'm going to try her way. \n For years and years I'd been reading about how Walt Whitman was this amazing American poet and how he's so many people's favourite, so I had high expectations going into this book. But when I started reading it, I found I couldn't follow it. \n I blame some of this on my education: after the fun poems you read in elementary school, which is where they teach you about rhythm and rhyming, you move on to trying to analyse 'themes' and 'symbolism' in high school, and heaven help you if you take an intro English course in university, where of course they'll force you to read TS Eliot's The Waste Land and then try to convince you that if you just close-read every line for the next month or so, you'll get it and it will become this beautiful work that explores Grand Themes and Important Ideas. It's almost like the education system tries to suck any joy you might have found in poetry out of the experience after the age of 12. Much better would have been to teach us how to read the damn things. \n But I digress. This is supposed to be about how it felt to read the book, which was confusing. I haven't read any books about Walt Whitman's poetry, and though I do have a podcast about The Leaves of Grass queued up on iTunes, I haven't listened to it yet. But I'm thinking that at least part of the confusion is deliberate and that he was writing in a stream-of-consciousness style that causes the works to jump around between ideas. It's also possible that I would have understood it more if I'd paid closer attention and either read the book in one go or at least every day, rather than over a couple of weeks. \n Podcast: BBC Radio 3's Free Thinking","date":"2016-07-24"}

Now, I don't outright hate the book, nor do I love it, but I'm \"sitting on the fence\". Out of 185 or so poems, I solidly loved nineteen of them. Those poems had struck a cord within me. I admire her straightforward style of poetry writing in that she is very candid and frank. However the amount of egregiously wasted pages spent on sentence poems - some of them even read like quotes. I think a few of these sentence poems could've been developed further into longer poems.","date":"2017-05-19"}

In fact, the title of each of their most famous poem is identical: \"The Fish.\" (Moore's fish are plural, Bishop's is singular.) \n Here's an easy way to remember the difference: Bishop is the one who writes a poem entitled \"Invitation to Miss Marianne Moore,\" in which the other poet is asked to \"please come flying\" over for a visit.

Then drink as much hard liquor as you can in one swig, run around your house twice, and lay down in the grass. \n That's almost an exact equivallence, I think. \n I will give you a representitive sample, suggest that reading Thomas really is a rewarding experience, and then go read Samuel Johnson or someone a little less, ah, druidic. \n The following is from his Prologue to the reader: \n ...I hack \n This rumpus of shapes \n For you to know \n How I, a spinning man, \n Glory also this star, bird \n Roared, sea born, man torn, blood blest. \n Hark: I trumpet the place, \n From fish to jumping hill! ... \n Note \"glory\" as transitive verb.

{"book_id":"133906","rating":3,"review_text":"This is a mammoth book: it's over six hundred big pages, and probably weighs a pound or so. It will look good on a shelf, and could possibly be useful in hurling at an enemy. \n It is also a very worthwhile read in that it traces the career of an important part of the history of American poetry: I mean Hughes himself, of course, but also a fascinating dance between political-'progressive' optimism and cynical realism. Hughes does this over and over in heartbreaking ways: he has to be one of our most unguarded poets since Whitman. \n He also looks at different phenomena of culture-- economics, religion, sexual ethics, the black/ white power struggle-- from seemingly every conceivable angle. Any one poem can seem simplistic, even foolishly simplistic, but the whole corpus gives you a rich, self-complicating pattern which qualifies and contradicts itself: everything is confusing, it all seems to say, but perhaps it shouldn't be. This is an essentially poetic way of looking at the world, and possibly the only sane way.","date":"2016-12-31"}

Another one: \"read,\" \"currently reading,\" and \"want to read,\" are inadequate for mutually exclusive categories! Other than that, keep it up; good stuff). \n The edition I want to talk up is the 1977 Yale imprint with Stephen Booth's editorship and criticism: this is particularly excellent because, 1) in addition to a modernized text of the sonnets, a facsimile text from the oldest available quartos, 2) Booth's commentary is extensive and helpful in teaching one to learn how to read poetry in general and Shakespeare in particular. \n \"Shakespeare often sacrifices grammar to euphony\"?

This is a relatively unique poem in that it deals with the sobering aspect of life together after the early stages of romance are done with, and the force of the rhythm does things you didn't know could be done.

(If you've read Shakespeare in the past, Hamlet is more on the Macbeth side than the Twelfth Night side.) \n Hamlet has a very compelling plot full of betrayal, love, and hate. It also includes most of the quotes that are iconically Shakespeare. (For example, \"to be or not to be\") \n It is a bit ridiculous at moments and incredibly serious at others, but it was fun to read. Despite being a tragedy, its mood was not too heavy. In fact, it had a few of my new favorite insults/ comebacks in it, which is always enjoyable. \n I'm not going to lie and say that it is easy to understand, but it is worthwhile if you want to give it a try!

{"book_id":"45974","rating":0,"review_text":"A sullenly beautiful work of introspection. Pessoa captures emotional ennui and disturbances of the soul, reflected back brilliantly and many times in his descriptive power of the environment. Repetitive, yes, in its burdened and laborious sighs. Purely philosophical meanderings in the style of ( and it feels pompous to write this) ars poetica, where the subject himself -- his writing habits, his self-conscious moods, his subjective observations and projections onto the world -- is the center of the text. As we know, Bernando Soares is only a stand-in for select outpourings of Fernando Pessoa's personality. Pessoa refers to Soares as the heteronym closest to him in countenance and mien. This book is essentially a journal, with sure veins of nonfiction running wildly through the prose. A worthy read if 2/3 of the way through you can keep up your endurance for melancholy and restlessness.","date":"2016-12-07"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"Este libro esta dividido en cuatro temas: the hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing. Cada poema cuenta una historia de amor, de dolor, de autoaceptacion, de abuso, de pensamientos depresivos, de sororidad. Es una escritura delicada y sensible pero fuerte en su contenido feminista. La moraleja pareciera ser, como enunciara alguna vez en twitter el famoso escritor Ezra Koenig, love yourselfie. \n Cuando leo poesia de este estilo, a veces la siento, la apropio, y a veces no logro hacer esta conexion. Esta vez sentia que me hablaba a mi, que en los ultimos anos atravese casi todo el proceso del libro, la depresion, el amor y el desamor, la amistad y la desamistad, la soledad, el aprender a reconciliarse con una misma, a fortalecerse antes de poder abrirse ante alguien, pero hacerlo bien. Por tratarse de una escritura muy intima y autobiografica, probablemente la experiencia de lectura no sea tan intensa y placentera si no sos una chica de veintitantos, pero me parece importante tambien para las chicas de veintitantos que aprendan el proceso, y completen el ciclo antes de seguir adelante. Tengo veinticuatro anos, me la paso nutriendome de feminismo, y eso me ayudo a fortalecerme en los momentos en los que sentia que no encajaba en el mundo. Una vez que estuve bien -ya hace alrededor de un ano- empece una relacion madura, feliz y super sana, que se aleja de los estandares de control y dependencia que abundan en la sociedad. \n Este fue el poema que mas me gusto. \n i do not want to have you \n to fill the empty parts of me \n i want to be full on my own \n i want to be so complete \n i could light a whole city \n and then \n i want to have you \n cause the two of us combined \n could set it on fire","date":"2017-04-19"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"4.5 \n I am not a big poetry reader not because I don't want to but I just don't know who to read.So when Ariel Basset on Youtube did a video about poetry to start with, I figured I would give it a try. This is a book of poetry divided into 4 parts, the hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing. The minute I got home from the bookstore I started reading the hurting. This part of the book is very difficult to read. It is about trauma and abuse. One poem in particular about cantelope I literally felt. After I finished that part I put it down for months. When I picked it up again I realized I should of powered through. The first part is the most difficult but then it gets way better. The loving is about love relationships. It was very relatable to me. The breaking is about breakups. I connected to a lot of poems in this section as well. The healing was amazing and I loved almost every poem in there. As a woman I would recommend this for every woman to read. This was a very raw, honest, wonderful read. I commend Rupi's bravery laying it all on the table in this book. As a side note I also enjoyed the drawings that went along with some of the poetry.","date":"2016-08-22"}

{"book_id":"1371","rating":4,"review_text":"Reading a story like The Iliad does a few thing. First, it reminds me how little mankind has changed in relation to our desires, our vices, and our virtues. Second, it reminds me how little stories have changed. Heroes, villains, gods (or circumstances beyond mortal control), death, honor (or lack thereof), love, hate. It's all here. In terms of being a milestone of Western literature, The Iliad deserves its place; nonetheless, readers will have to abandon some of their modern sensibilities when it comes to narrative and structure in order to enjoy it. \n Some of the oddities (for a modern audience) of The Iliad's narrative become very apparent very quickly. For example, the author appears as much interested in providing otherwise irrelevant genealogies in the middle of a frantic battle scene as he does in describing the battle. This could become tedious, as it did for me at times, for a modern reader. Yet, I felt it provided an interesting insight into what societies of that age valued. Honor and glory was inextricably linked with family and duty. Knowing which Trojan slew which Achaean (Greek) was critically important. Furthermore, readers of today may assume they know certain elements of the story and be somewhat surprised by the \"true\" story. For example, the love affair between Helen and Paris is hardly mutual. Helen despises Paris, as do most of the Trojans, for the misery of war he has brought upon both peoples. (At the start of the story, which actually chronicles the end of the war and ignores its beginning, the Achaeans are debating over and struggling with what I couldn't help but see as the sunk-cost fallacy). There is no \"true love\" story to be found here between the two individuals at the center of the war. \n Moving beyond the story's antiquated elements, the myth is as compelling as one would expect. There is both admirable heroism and repulsive cowardice on display in this tale. I admit I really enjoy these \"Sword and Sandal\" stories, especially those which emphasize attributes not usually heralded in modern culture. (Gates of Fire was my favorite fiction book in 2015). When I read the following statement from Odysseus--\"Though cowards quit the field, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must stand firm and hold his own\"--I am moved by the courage and honor of a bygone era. Subscribing to the Joseph Campbell school of thought, I think The Iliad showcases those elements of The Hero's Journey we're still witnessing in story after story after story. To my earlier point, although The Iliad's structure and pacing is odd to us; it's not all that different from our modern stories. Reading The Iliad not only provides insight into an ancient culture and ancient peoples, it provides insight into ourselves. We are not all that different from our distant ancestors. \n The Iliad is wonderful. It is, in my opinion, as relevant today as it was when it was first recorded. True, a reader may have to sift through seemingly irrelevant elements of the story, but the fundamentals of this story--love, loss, war, hate, honor, and, yes, even faith--are as compelling today as they were thousands of year ago. \n http://thethousanderclub.blogspot.com/","date":"2017-08-18"}

{"book_id":"12914","rating":3,"review_text":"Great translation -- smooth and readable English. Don't use this for philological work (the translation is faithful, but loose), but do use it for getting a good impression of the poem as a whole. \n On the poem as a whole: obviously, this is a major work of Western literature with deep resonance throughout late antiquity, medieval, and renaissance culture. That said, it is basically propaganda for the nascent empire of Augustus. It is not subtle about this, and basically everything the main character does is connected in some way to territorial claims for Rome or to the cultural reform agenda of Augustus. It is also pretty misogynist, and again -- not subtle. It does have some lovely moments of profundity and insight, and rewards careful reading, but it is what it is: ancient, beautiful, propaganda.","date":"2016-01-28"}
{"book_id":"18263725","rating":5,"review_text":"So far, I think The Crossover is surprisingly my favorite of this year's Mid-Level Sequoyah nominees. I generally do not care for free verse novels, but the rhythm of The Crossover lends itself more to the rhythm of a basketball thumping on a court. The rap-like style works well with the narrator's voice, a junior high kid who loves his family and basketball above all else. Speaking of the narrator, this novel has one of the most authentic voices for an 8th grader that I've ever read. I could almost hear my former 7th graders in this novel. As an educator, I love that The Crossover slips in vocabulary as part of the narrative and even mentions Tanka poetry. Thanks to the free verse format, I read this in a morning in one sitting, so I think reluctant readers will definitely be able to handle it, and more avid readers will enjoy analyzing the style. Be forewarned, however. I am not a cryer, but I may have let a few tears slip for The Crossover.","date":"2016-06-02"}

There were a few poems that really resonated with me. I think Milk and Honey is inspiring for young people to read poetry and it's a great accomplishment Rupi Kaur can be proud of. I liked the fact that this book is written from a female perspective and this femininity made it even better for me. You can feel that the writer is truly a warm person and I liked her style of poetry which also was a reflection of her honesty. Maybe not everyone has a taste for this especially because of the way it was written. It's made of basic sentences which, for me, is the most striking thing about the book. But of course poetry, after all, is very subjective. Overall I loved the book and I think it deserves the recognition but at the end it still feels like it's a rough draft. I didn't like the negative spaces. I get why people think it's mediocre but I believe Kaur has a potential and she will improve. I will gladly wait for her future projects now.","date":"2016-05-10"}

What was the most interesting experience was listening to a couple of the stories on The Classic Tales podcast. B.J. Harrison narrates \"The Purloined Letter\" and \"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\" with suspense, just enough sound effects, and an intelligent commentary.

{"book_id":"99944","rating":4,"review_text":"The Bhagavad Gita details the spiritual journey of Arjuna, someone who is guided by the teachings of Krishna. Arjuna is at a crossroads and doesn't know who he should trust, but he discovers that Krishna is a loving God giving him counsel. Arjuna is about to go to war and Krishna gives him advice on religious devotion, violence, and yoga, among other things. \n The story's structure was accessible and each discourse was organized in such a way that it was easy for me to follow along. The concepts discussed in the text weren't simple ideas, but the way each section was organized made the reading straightforward. I was able to clearly see where each section began and ended, therefore where the separation of ideas took place. \n Throughout the book, three main teachings were explored: devotion, action, and knowledge. I originally thought that these would be applied only to Arjuna's dilemma, but the teachings were related to yoga practices as well. Krishna's advice is that the true yogi follows his teachings and keeps his mind occupied on his practice. I found that some of the advice dispensed to Arjuna in the story applied to me in my practice, or even lines about how a person should live their life in relation to their yoga practice. \"...From where does pleasure come for the one who has no peace?\" These words made me believe that Krishna not only wanted Arjuna to make an informed decision about his future, but he wanted Arjuna to seek peace for himself as well. This advice is something I need to remind myself of. Sometimes I forget that if I'm unhappy, I can't be confident about myself and find inner peace. \n When I first started reading the story, I expected specific yoga postures to be referenced. I realized that Krishna was advising Arjuna more on a mindful and religious state of yoga. His words were focused on purposeful intent and the benefits of the yoga of action, knowledge, and devotion. \"...Nor does one reach fulfilment only be renunciation,\" is said after Krishna references the yoga of action. It is another piece of advice that holds multiple meanings for me. This reminds me of the Buddha refusing to become an ascetic in order to reach a tranquil state. He too wanted to reach \"fulfilment,\" but not by starving himself from the beneficial aspects of life. This is something I too am learning about. When practicing yoga, I try to pay attention to how much discomfort I am experiencing. When I descend into a posture, I need to remind myself that some discomfort is fine, but I shouldn't allow myself to be in pain. If I reach \"fulfilment\" through pain, then I'm not really experiencing yoga. \n In conclusion, I think that The Bhagavad Gita can be read as a religious text, or for yoga research. The teachings are rooted in the Indian culture, so I could see this book being beneficial for someone wanting to understand Hinduism. Some of the names of the Hindu gods were already familiar to me after reading The Ramayana. Even though The Ramayana was written after The Bhagavad Gita, both are steeped in Indian culture. For example, I was familiar with Rama and the concept of him being an avatar. Although The Ramayana was only referenced a few times in the book's Notes section, I had read another book about Indian mythology beforehand; this helped me to better understand The Bhagavad Gita.","date":"2016-08-02"}
{"book_id":"18003300","rating":4,"review_text":"3.8 (and if you're seeing this added line of text next to this number and it's new to you that means I did a quick edit to add in stuff)) \n This is what happened: I opened the book. I read a few poems and thought they were good. Then there was what felt like 10 really bad ones, poems that just seemed too easy or lazily written. After this it got back to being okay, and then good and then it got intriguingly good and it kept that way minus one poem nearer to the end of the book which was of the worst but what's perfect. \n This is the style of the book: Markedly simple (duh) aspects and situations of love. It ranges from very short poems that are two couplets long with sometimes boring diction to several couplets with a very sweet package to single-page poems presented in two parts, one being a long usually reflective prosey thing--[page-break]--and concludes with haikuesque dialog which very clearly parallels the story. The book has an economy on words but a vast desert of blankness and the text is a little too small. \n The poems are like this poem which I am going to improvise: \n {Far away I always felt \n Caught by a line reeling. \n I finally spotted that fisher \n in the garden of roses kneeling \n And we united with our scents \n like a couple remembering our charms, healing.} \n They are usually a lot more simple then this however, this is more accurate: \n {Finally blurting \"I love you\" \n We both stopped like old fish dying \n We now started our lives now \n when he admitted \"I'll try too\"} \n Book-This-Contains-Also fun art. They remind me of Mark Ryden, cuz they're doll like figures, zah old kinde. \n I read Dirty Pretty Things by Lang Leav's lover which I think one-ups this book and is mostly unrepentantly erotic unlike Love & Misadventure. So I recommend that but it's still rather but not-as-much sparse like the book this review is about. \n Stuff I added near-immediately after posting my review that I mentioned as editblahs: I would re-read this book however, which is more than I could say for most collections of poetry but maybe because the contents are a digestible as popcorn but gets the emotions out just as simple and tasty. However some of the corn-clouds will be burnt un-popped or get stuck in your gums while you enjoy your meal. \n I'm going to absolutely stress that these poems from both authors are mostly incredibly sparse and it takes some adjusting to or they're not for everyone. Like popcorn (which is a sort of special occasion gimmicky cheap if not overpriced snack if it doesn't stand out in the crowd like a nude parade in terms of taste or visuals) the book is good but I don't see how I could fall in love with it like some of the other reviewers here. I think they are a little too ticklish but here's another metaphor: each poem is like an individual inch long feather: they tickle but only go as far as an inch will go for you unless you absolutely savor it or have never felt the feeling before. Someone is bound to make a sex joke out of that. I'll just probably read these quickly but maybe I'll savor it more and report my findings. I found Pretty Dirty Things to be a more profound time-taking read however.","date":"2016-02-25"}

There was a clear purpose behind the length of sentences, they were fully formed sentences, and line breaks were used appropriately (*cough* Milk and Honey *cough*). \n The Seat Next To You - \"When I sit near you, my hands suddenly become alien things and I don't know where to put them or what they usually do, like this is the first time I've ever had hands and maybe they go in my pockets and maybe they don't.\" \n The Floor Takes So Long To Hit - \"Congratulations. You took me down. And now, you have made everything that is sad, relevant.\" \n Anthology format: \n I loved the photographs with the poems. I could form a connection between the pictures and each poem, although of course that connection is left up to interpretation. \n The book of poems is comprised of four parts: Sun, Moon, Stars, and Rain. I couldn't figure out the connection between the poems and the name of each section. Although maybe they have some kind of metaphorical connection I didn't catch onto? Each section had a good selection of poems, but my favorite section of poems was definitely Stars. I was literally bookmarking nearly every poem in that section. \n A few of my other favorite poems were: \n The Moths Don't Die For Nothing - \"I'm sure people just kiss each other. I'm sure that sometimes you're talking and somehow two people move closer and closer to each other and then, they just kiss. I'm sure it happens all the time. But I'm also sure that a kiss is never just a kiss.\" \n The Heart Beats Per Minute \"You are the best parts of all the songs I love.\"","date":"2016-09-12"}

{"book_id":"6295","rating":5,"review_text":"While I've spent a great deal of time sampling the likes of great Beat prose, I hadn't really encountered any of the poetry, unless you want to count tiny snippets included in The Dharma Bums. As such, I figured Howl was probably the place to start; I was most definitely tickled pink when I came across it at my local Chapters, allowing me to read it without having to buy the complete writings of Ginsberg for a significant investment, the only book of Ginsberg's writing that I was able to find within the confines of their walls for at least several months. I'm actually glad I hadn't read through Howl before now, before reading through other Beat literature, as I very readily grasped several references that I would likely have otherwise needed to research further. (Of course, I still read through each poem in the collection multiple times and looked elsewhere to aid in my understanding of this landmark book.) \n In Howl, Ginsberg relates how things used to be, he tells us what he and others have been through, and he relates how everything changed. It's a lament of how the good times were now gone, of how noble dreams were crushed, and how delusional some of those dreams actually were. As the poem progresses, he offers up the demon of (then) modern society as the source of blame for these woes, and that he worries that it's claiming him as well. As depressing as Howl remains throughout, the footnote reminds us that all is not lost, that there's plenty still worth fighting for. While Howl definitely shines the brightest out of the collection, Ginsberg's talent of evocative expression still extends to the other poems. I personally very much enjoyed the inspiring melancholia at the heart of Sunflower Sutra, the author's suggestion that the modern world is also killing the soul. \n Poignant and raw throughout, Howl and Other Poems is necessary reading for both lovers of prose and poetry. It's not at all surprising to me that, with his book, Ginsberg developed such a lasting legacy.","date":"2016-07-21"}
{"book_id":"23534","rating":5,"review_text":"At the time of writing this, I just finished getting through a stack of poetry in preparation for an author panel event I was tasked at moderating, and, aside from perhaps Ezra Pound's Cathay, this was likely my favourite collection. The trouble is I'm having some difficulty getting at the why of it all. \n Perhaps it's due to the honesty I feel when I read through Bukowski's poems. The author definitely doesn't mince words and also never strays away from difficult, depressing, and even disgusting subjects. In doing so, he not only cultivates this honesty, but he even occasionally hits on a great profundity that I suspect would more easily pass you by if you attempted to broach such things while dancing around them. Of course, this will also make the collection unpalatable to many a reader, especially when you consider how much of it talks about his alcoholism and womanizing, even going so far as to discuss things like public masturbating. \n I realize how much this is going to make me come across as a terrible person, but this at least partially explains how Bukowski finds some of his charm. Similar to someone like Walt Whitman - more on him in a couple weeks - Bukowski makes it at least somewhat clear that he thinks very highly of himself. But, unlike Whitman, he's an oftentimes depressed nihilist who is sometimes quite self-deprecating, and quite open when recalling embarrassing anecdotes, such as the hung-over poetry reading in which he threw up in a grand piano. What comes across is less a man balancing on a pedestal that I want to knock over, and more a real, flawed person. \n So, while it's definitely not for everyone, I found Love is a Dog from Hell to be quite enjoyable. These musings from a dirty old man are crass, sparse, and depressing, but sincere and oftentimes hilarious.","date":"2016-03-24"}
{"book_id":"15997","rating":4,"review_text":"I will have to make mention of my unfamiliarity with the style of language and literature, when approaching an epic poem the likes of Paradise Lost. This isn't to say I had an impossible time understanding the Renaissance English; it just took me much longer to get through. (And, you know, the frequent notes were helpful.) I am, however, thankful that I stuck with the difficult task, as Milton's poem chronicling the fall of Satan and the subsequent corruption and expulsion of Man from the Garden of Eden is beautifully written and surprisingly informative. \n I suppose the informative side of things comes more from my failings. Perhaps I didn't read enough of my Bible, or perhaps I didn't pay close enough attention in church, but I learned important, though basic, tenets of Christian theological logic, such as why Jesus was the only one who could die for our sins or why the Tree of Knowledge was in Paradise. The author is very careful in his explanations, going far out of his way to not blame The Lord for the transgressions of Man and Foe, to the point where God starts sounding, frankly, a bit defensive as he speaks. But who am I to judge? As interesting as I found these teachings, however, I think the big, juicy excitement to be taken from Paradise Lost is in Milton's use of language. At first, I thought it was merely due to the superb wordplay he employs - the likes of which are unmatched, barring, perhaps, the writings of Vladimir Nabokov - but it's more than that. The ambiguous language and puns galore come primarily from the legion of sinners. Satan uses this strategy to sound more persuasive, though his arguments often ring hollow; this comes to great effect against Eve (spoiler), and seems to make him much more enticing to many readers. (I will admit I fell under his spell, as I was often much more excited to hear him and his rebellious horde converse than members of the holy army.) Conversely, God and the angels lack this ambiguity, this wordplay, as they do not lie; Milton was showing that there is consistency between their words and message, despite my earlier concerns about the godly defensiveness. \n Unfortunately, the biggest failing of Paradise Lost isn't the old English, but, rather, that large chunks of the poem are tedious as all hell. So, it's good, really good, in fact, but it's very difficult to recommend picking it up just for a fun read.","date":"2016-01-28"}

But then again, I'm still a newbie to poetry, so I don't know if it's just my inexperience or if I just don't care for the style of writing Kaur utilizes. \n However, the content of this collection of poetry was powerful. I think my favorite chapter was 'the healing' - it was so empowering to read. It was beautiful to read the words of Kaur - especially since she was so open and raw with what she put onto paper. \n There were a couple of times that the poems felt a little repetitive - especially when it came to talking about not needing a man and also allowing hair to grow on our bodies. But even with those couple of repetitions, I still really enjoyed this.","date":"2017-08-04"}

{"book_id":"1381","rating":5,"review_text":"The Journey Of The West \n Homer's Odyssey is the prototypical \"journey\" of Western literature. The epic tells of the wanderings of the Greek hero Odysseus, King of Ithaca. Odysseus spent ten years with the Greeks at Troy (he is an important character in Homer's Iliad) and devised the strategem of the Trojan Horse which led to the fall of Troy. Following the fall of Troy, Odysseus wandered for ten years before his return to Ithaca. The Odyssey celebrates his trials during this long period and his ultimate vindication upon his return to Ithaca. \n The Odyssey differs in tone and content from the Iliad. Simone Weil, a mid-20th century French writer, described the Iliad as the work of Western literature which best explored the use and limitations of force. Battle scenes, death, and the human cost and folly of war are realistically if heroically described. The Odyssey is more in the nature of romance. It surely has moments of grandeur and heroism, but its story is in the telling and in the journeying and in the adventures of Odysseus along the way. \n The tale of the Iliad, and of Achilles' wrath, involves only a few days in the Trojan War and the poet of the Iliad recounts his story in a forward-moving chronology. The story is focused in that the main action takes place entirely in Troy and its environs. The Odyssey is much more diffuse, covering as it does the wanderings of Odysseus for ten years. The scene shifts frequently and the story is told with flashbacks and shifting tenses and locations. The bulk of the action (the last 12 books of the epic) occur in Ithaca after Odysseus returns home. These books are recounted in the voice of the poet. (Homer) The first four books of the Odyssey recount a smaller-scale journey of Telemachus, Odysseus's son, as he searches for news of his father and tries to avoid death at the hands of the suitors of Penelope who are plaguing Ithaca and plundering Odysseus's estate. (In addition, many of the women servants are having affairs with the suitors.) The middle section of the book deals with Odysseus's adventures, with mythical characters such as the Cyclops, Scylla and Charibdis, the rock-throwing Laestroginians, the Lotus eaters, the sirens, and many others. We learn of Odysseus's long but ultimately unsatisfactory dalliances with Circe and with Callypso and his perseverance in returning home. \n The most striking element of the poem for me was Book 11 which chronicles Odysseus's journey to Hades and which teaches him that human life is precious and irreplaceable for all its pain and suffering. Much of the middle section of the book is told as a flashback with Odysseus speaking in his own voice. There is much in the Odyssey (unlike the Iliad) about the nature and function of epic poetry and about its performance. \n The Odyssey concludes with Odysseus' slaughter of the many suitors of his faithful wife Penelope and with his reuniting with his wife, aged father Laertes and son Telemachus. Odysseus is a wily, much-battered, and cunning hero. But in his perseverance and strength, he is a hero nonetheless. \n The Odyssey is a much-translated work. I found this translation by Robert Fagles helped me get into and involved with the poem. The translation is in a modern American free verse idiom which to me lets the poem speak and does not call attention to itself as a translation. For a work such as the Odyssey, I think that if the translation moves and the reader is drawn into the work, the translator is doing a good job. By this test, the translation is outstanding. \n There is an excellent introduction by Bernard Knox which introduces the reader to the scholarly issues surrounding the composition of the Odyssey and the Iliad and which discusses as well the major themes of the poem. \n The Odyssey and the Iliad are works to be read and reread at many stages of life. They should probably be explored in several translations for those, (most readers) who don't read the original Greek. This is a stirring epic poem of what has become the journey of the West. \n Robin Friedman","date":"2017-04-20"}

In its sweep lies war and death, honor and pettiness, mortality, domesticity, gods and men. \n In his excellent introduction to this edition and translation by Robert Fagles, Bernard Knox writes that the Iliad probably was written down between 725 and 675 B.C. It tells a story that was archaic even for its time that is set around 1200 B.C. The story of the Iliad covers a matter of days in the tenth and final year of the Trojan War. It is allusive to the entire mythology of that ancient struggle. The tale is deliberately mythical, with characters and emotions that, Homer tells us many times, are larger than those of men today. For too many, the Iliad comes encrusted as a \"classic\". People read it, or portions of it, in high school or college and inevitably miss much of the grandeur and wisdom of the work. \n When I came back to the Iliad recently (after not having read the work in many years) in this translation by Fagles, I was swept away. I accompanied my reading of the Iliad with an excellent series of lecture tapes on the poem and its background. I thought the translation, written in a modern colloquial free verse helped me to understand and read the poem. The translation, for me, gives the reader a sense of the repetitions, formulas and phraseology of the original. It has a sweep to it, and the style and translation does not get in the way of understanding the work. This is important in a modern translation of an ancient work. The translation was easy to follow and got me involved in the tale. I am sure the poem works differently in the ancient Greek than in this translation. But this is largely irrelevant to the virtue of Fagles's work which makes the Iliad come alive and roar in a manner which encourages the nonclassicist modern reader to approach it. \n There are a multitude of themes in the Iliad. At the beginning of the work, Homer invokes his muse and announces that the work will deal with the \"rage of Achilles.\" The work is about human anger and rage on a grand scale and about the waste, but strange grandeur of war. In his introduction, Bernard Knox quotes approvingly from Simone Weil, writing in France during World War II, who described the Iliad as the West's leading work on the use and nature of Force. The Iliad speaks deeply about the human condition, about the tragedy and heroism that human mortality makes possible, and about how people may learn to change and to understand others. \n I found Bernard Knox' introduction and notes helpful in understanding the controversies surrounding the writing of the Iliad and in giving the reader some of the basic tools to think about the work. Whether the reader is approaching the Iliad for the first time or after many times, there is much to be gained from reading this basic text of the West. Fagles' translation will help bring the reader to the Iliad. \n Robin Friedman","date":"2017-04-01"}

{"book_id":"402128","rating":4,"review_text":"This was pretty charming. As it was for kids it had more of the quaint, rhythmic elements of Eliot's idiom and not so much of the detached, Eastern feel, although there was still a little of that. \n I love the way he portrays these cats in such an anthropomorphic, children's sort of way and at the same time does so in a way that genuinely reminds you of a lot of cats that you've met in real life. These cats are fantastical and yet somehow still well observed and true to life. Ted Hughes wrote about how poets capture the essence of their subject by whatever means necessary and this is what Eliot has done with Cats in this book. He has written something silly and entertaining and yet the true essence of his subject has been captured brilliantly. \n Strongly recommended to anyone who likes cats or TS Eliot.

{"book_id":"82356","rating":3,"review_text":"Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man? am I myself? \n -Act 3, Scene 2 \n A silly little comedy, fun and insubstantial. As the title suggests, Shakespeare's love for disguises and mistaken identities is already on full display in this early play, with not one but two sets of identically-named identical twins wreaking havoc on the city of Ephesus. Since the premise alone strains the willing suspension of disbelief to the breaking point, Shakespeare is under little obligation to make his play \"realistic\"; whatever complexity there is to be found here comes more from the twists and turns of the plot and the mental strain of keeping the characters straight than from those characters' psychological depth. \n Reading his early plays, it becomes clear that Shakespeare, like many struggling entertainers and artists today, began his career simply trying to please a crowd and get his foot in the proverbial door. Once he'd started making a name for himself--and honed his skills a bit--he was able to shift focus to the richer and more memorable material we know him for today. Plays like The Comedy of Errors and \n Titus Andronicus \n may not have much to offer modern readers, but without them we never have gotten the Shakespeare we now know and revere.","date":"2017-08-01"}

The entire book is full of poems with a variety of characters. The illustrations are done in black and white and are featured throughout the book in select poems.

The poems featured in this collection are fun and very creative. I think the variety of characters and original titles put a fun twist on this collection. The poems have a broad range of lengths and styles. I believe that this book is very realistic and relatable for kids, even though a lot of it is made up and full of imagination. I think the range of diversity is crucial for the children to understand. In poems like Colors (pg.24) and No Difference (pg.81) show how everyone is equal no matter what they look like.

{"book_id":"2547","rating":4,"review_text":"This was a philosophical and inspirational read. One could just skim over it, as it's only over a hundred pages, but I believe it to be one of those books that should be savored and picked apart. \n It is a collection of passages, each one dedicated to a particular emotion such as love, reason and passion, pain, joy and sorrow, self-knowledge; a specific deed like teaching, talking, giving, buying and selling, eating and drinking and other life-relevant topics that include freedom, crime and punishment, laws, religion and death. There are more, I haven't included them all, but each one is an imperative part of every person's existence. \n The wisdom and sentiment portrayed is indeed exceptional. What really stood out for me in this book, was how the author managed to make the profound philosophies of life sound lyrical and simple. Reading this was an enriching and enlightening experience. More than likely I'll re-read it. \n Picking a favorite quote is very difficult. To give an idea of the style of the book, I am writing below an excerpt from what the author has to say about \"talking\". Being an introvert and hence not a huge fan of small talks, I have to say, I appreciate these lines a lot. \n \"You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts; And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart, you live in your lips and sound is a diversion and a pastime. And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered. For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly.\"","date":"2016-11-07"}

In you everything sank!\" \n It is no wonder Pablo Neruda was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. \n However, what did not appeal to me was the objectification of women.

The topics are important though, but they do seem very random and not connected. Except for the first chapter I felt like she was only talking about a romantic relationship, she wants me to understand that I don't need a man yet she bases all her little quotes on that relationship with a man. As if she has just experienced her first, truly hurtful break up and had all these basic thoughts... basic because none of these quotes were in any way deep enough to consider thinking about them, it was more like \"oh yeah, I felt that way too\". Not once was I impressed by her writing/wording, rather annoyed by the many times she pressed enter, to fill the page? Cause the words couldn't fill it with their meaning, so extra bonus for the reader he gets to see some pictures, they also didn't impress me. I did get the feeling several times that the author actually wanted to write about her experience but didn't know how so she just skipped to the \"good\" parts, the ones that are memorizing (would this be a full length novel) and called it poetry.

She tells her own story through poems/verse and it's a work of art. \n Growing up in the 1960s and 1970s in South Carolina and New York she tells her story of what it's like to live as an african american and her awareness of the Civil Rights Movement. She moves from Ohio to South Carolina to New York with many losses and gains in between. She shares her likes and dislikes of city living and the hustle and bustle of New York versus the big front porches and lush green neighborhoods of the south. \n I've read books written in verse before and none of them were as emotionally driven or colorful as Brown Girl Dreaming. I was in awe of how beautiful the way each poem told a new part of the story. For it to be written from a child's perspective, it's impressively convincing. I find it to be a difficult perspective to successfully convey and Woodson seems to have done it with ease. So far this is one of my favorite reads of 2016.","date":"2016-04-29"}

Plath's poems are full of personal associations and allusions. This makes her poetry very complicated, but it is also fascinating to see how rich her inner world was. \n And even though I sometimes struggled through her works, there were poems which I really liked.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"2.5 stars \n Let's just start with I agree with all of the overall themes book gave out, and perhaps because I'm prone being picky when it comes to how sentimentally \"deep\" a book is, this book was not for me. I love poetry, and perhaps this book is nice and fresh for some, but this felt like beginner's level poetry for me. I did however LOVE the illustrations in this book, and if they were a separate book I would have given them five stars alone. To me, most of these poems were just a collection of scattered words and random metaphors. The pattern of the few poems I did enjoy were a bit longer than the rest of the poem, and I realize if Kaur had developed some of her messages I might have actually enjoyed more of her poems. I really appreciated the messages Kaur attempted to spread, but when a poem had six words, and three word breaks, it just felt more in the format of a poem rather than being an actual poem. \n There were some poems like: \n \"you \n are your own \n soul mate.\" \n Again, great message, but if I knew this is the poetry that has been such highly praised, I would not have picked up this book in the first place. \n And then rare poems like this, which was probably my most enjoyed poem (If only the novel included more of these): \n \"you tell me \n i am not like most girls \n and learn to kiss me with your eyes closed \n something about the phrase--something about \n how i have to be unlike the women \n i call sisters in order to be wanted \n makes me want to spit your tongue out \n like i am supposed to be proud you picked me \n as if i should be relieved you think \n i am better than them\" \n The message of this one was not only so clearly conveyed, but it was well developed, unlike many of the other poems. \n \"but \n for some overrated poetry \n there is bound \n to be \n unpopular opinions \n and maybe \n because i have them \n it makes me \n different from the rest \n but in all fairness \n i will not apologize \n for being different\" \n -- me \n Huh, maybe I should write a poetry book. \n *also wanted to add something to this review. \n I've read many comments saying that this book doesn't deserve a low rating because the author poured her raw feelings into this book, and so it shouldn't be judged. Most authors do that. If you were to rate a book based on how well you think the author put their feelings into a book when they wrote it, I would give all the books I read five stars, because I'm aware on how hard each author works when they write.","date":"2016-06-20"}
{"book_id":"46199","rating":3,"review_text":"I read this book as a recommendation from my friend Daniela. Thank you for your suggestion as I enjoyed most of my reading (short one). \n First, I think that this book, or better say, these letters are one sided. It only gave me a faint clue of what had the sender written, and all I could rely on were Rilke's words. \n Talking about the latter, I think that he had a good point of view about life. I enjoyed the fact that he would compare the childhood with one's own way of figuring life and relating it to our inner emotions. I also liked the fact that whenever Rilke would respond, it would be because of a cause. He wouldn't bother writing when he didn't have the opportunity to give a decent answer. He'd never go with a plain one. But as he'd write he'd get lost in a sea of words, he'd take you to his own thoughts placed carefully on the letter, leaving their mark, and then as unexpected as it could be, he'd give an end to it. It had to have an end eventually, but it was hard to grasp the next letter's content. \n In the last letter, what made an impression on me, was the way it started and ended. Seemed like he had already said it all and after receiving the last letter, his response showed that he had finally achieved what he wanted. His 'student' had understood his lessons about life, and he could go on now, knowing that he had been a good guide and teacher. \n All in all, as one sided these letters were, you could find something meaningful there, something related personally to you, something that you had already known.","date":"2016-08-15"}
{"book_id":"18003300","rating":3,"review_text":"Contemporary poetry intrigues me. It's either a hit or miss. As a writer of contemporary poetry, I love getting my hands on any such collection. Sometimes, contemporary poetry is raw and full of straightforward passion. Other times, such poetry is vague with simple rhyme that leaves a taste in my mouth. Not a bad taste - but the kind of aftertaste that gives me pause. Love & Misadventure has more of the kind of poetry that captures me, with a tiny aftertaste. \n The book is a quick read, and I was enthralled. Poetry is meant to portray the perspective of the writer, and that's what this collection does. Leav's imagery of glass shards and Christmas wrappings and songs sung are beautiful and show a new perspective, making me expect one thing and experience another. \n Some poems contain simple rhyme, and rhymes at the end of each line tend to irritate me. Maybe because that's how I used to think poetry should only be? When there is a short poem of four lines that end with the words deplore/ignored/for/bore, it just feels too in-my-face for me. That's just personal taste - I prefer hidden rhymes that make the reader do a double-take and read the poem again to decipher the puzzle. Occasionally words would be misspelled for the sake of holding the rhyme together, which felt forced. \n My only critique in terms of content is the theme that pops up again and again of romance equating ownership. The type of love that is described in this book is more like infatuation, or the beginning stages of what could become love over time. \n Overall, I enjoyed this book of poems. The ending felt a bit abrupt and I was left wanting more. Heartbreak and love are universal themes that are reflected in this collection.","date":"2017-06-28"}

He came off as cocky when describing his abilities in the game of basketball. As the story progressed, Josh let his guard down, revealing the relatable insecurities of a young teenager. \n I was able to get a glimpse into the struggles of a successful young person. From the outside, Josh is everything I wasn't at 13. He's well-off, seemingly confident, social, an Honor-roll student, and a stand-out athlete. He's the kind of kid I would've loved to have switched places with then. To have been able to see how the pressure of juggling everything at once could overwhelm even the strongest kids would have been a great help for me when I was growing up, \n when i thought that everything seemed so easy for some people. \n Really fast paced, with a lot happening with very little words.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"Loved this book so much that almost at once I was tempted to connect with this beautiful author. I am happy Rupi answered a few questions for me and the interview was published by Quint. So excited!! \n Author Rupi Kaur on Ignoring the \"No One Will Marry You\" Jibes \n For one whose book of poetry was rejected by all the major publishers, Rupi Kaur's labour of love, milk and honey, released in 2015, has spent over a year on the NYT bestsellers list. As the interest in her writing continues to grow unabated, and not just in India, but across the world, this Canadian poet, writer and illustrator of Indian origin , is ready with her latest book, the sun and her flowers, to be released on the 3rd October this year. And while she wrote about love, loss, trauma, abuse, healing and femininity in her first book, she has explored the themes of self, family, and community in her second, those, in addition to many others. In an exclusive interview to Vani, a former business journalist and author of The Recession Groom, Rupi talked about her publishing journey and her upcoming book. Excerpts from an email exchange between the two authors: \n Vani: Congratulations on the stupendous success of your book, Rupi!! \n Rupi: Thank you! It's a joy to talk. \n Vani: What is the one reason you think your poetry has resonated with people across the world? \n Rupi: I feel that within my work, I'm dissecting emotion and in doing so, there's a tremendous amount of self-reflection. When a reader reads that reflection, it allows them to do the same. The work is also accessible and I'm writing in a form that I would like to read. \n Vani: Do you consider yourself a thinker...a philosopher? Do you even like it when people try to box you into some mould they know or understand? \n Rupi: I'm naturally a thinker. And I write about experience--my lived experience, and I don't know if there's a maturity--I'm striving for something resembling maturity, I think! A part of that natural growth means understanding and reflecting upon what I'm going through as well as improving my craft as a writer. \n I create what I want to create about the experiences around me. Occasionally that means being categorized as this or that. I don't pay much mind to characterizations to be honest. I realize there's only so much I can control, and my focus and energy needs to be on creating the work I want to create. \n Vani: Not the first time anyone has asked you this, but, were you scared to express yourself so openly? Scared of your community or your parents or future in-laws? \n Rupi: Yes. Before I began to put out my work, no one had ever seen that side of me. Even though that was me, I was quiet and kind of blended into a background. I had years and years of people telling me, \"No one is going to marry you if you do this or that.\" \n But when I began to express myself, my mind went to--\"Oh well, its out there...this is the real me--whatever happens, happens.\" I think its important to know that while those trepidations exist and are natural, its vital to document and share our experiences--whatever the consequences might be. \n And I also feel that for so many younger authors and poets looking to put their work \"out there\", the world can be extremely harsh. There will be a million detractors hoping to cut and tear at every word that is released. I think that scares so many young writers. So much of the room for error a young individual might need to grow into themselves is simply non-existent. \n Vani: Something now about your style of poetry-- micro poetry, as we know it. Was it a conscious effort because you probably understood that people do not have a great attention span? Or is it just the way poetry comes to you, in short verses? \n Rupi: Poetry comes to me in this way. Growing up in a Sikh household, we're imbued with poetry from the moment we are born. This poetry is sung through shabads and becomes ever-present in our lives. Our names comes from poetry, when I get married it will be verse which rings in the ceremony and when I pass, it will be to the sounds of poetry once again. These experiences and the poetry and music of my youth became a source for my stylistic inspirations. Later, I would discover the work of contemporary and historical poets who wrote in a similar short verse that my inner minimalist gravitated towards. \n Vani: Considering as you self-published your book, were you disappointed with the publishers and how they perceived the value of a book? Have your views changed over a period of time? \n Rupi: I'm so glad I self-published initially. I mean, it was as much out of necessity as anything else. There was no one willing to publish my work. There was no market for it. So, self-publishing enabled me to make the work I wanted to create. It was just me--so I had complete creative freedom and control! This creative control was most important. I didn't want a publisher to come in and control the art. I wanted to design the cover. I wanted to lay the book out. It was my heart on paper. I wanted to pick the size, font and colours. Years of study in visual rhetoric and design lead me to fall in love with print and graphic art and I wanted to be involved in every part of that process. When I was eventually contacted by Andrews Mcmeel Publishing, they worked with the creative vision that was already there. They respected my work as a writer and an artist and I was extremely lucky to have a seamless transition into that world as well. \n Vani: A few words about your latest book that releases on the 3rd of October, the sun and her flowers. What can the readers expect from it? Also, having dealt with love, loss, trauma, healing and femininity in your first book, milk and honey, what are the other themes that you are willing to explore? \n Rupi: I'm so excited for the sun and her flowers to be out there! I feel it is a sibling to milk and honey. It's taken so much work. Years of writing and editing and creating. I think there's been a natural growth in my writing which I'm excited about and I've been able to delve deeper not only in the themes of milk and honey, but also begin to explore themes of love, self, family, and community. I also speak a bit about my mother and her journey. Also, of the immigrant experiences and the rooting of yourself in a space. At its heart, its the story of a young girl trying to find her way. The loss of a love, the loss of your own love. The rooting of oneself within a place. The search for hope. The blossoming of an empowering love. \n Vani: A few words for young writers out there... \n Rupi: Write. Write and Write. And when and if you're ready, let the world know of the beautiful thoughts of your beautiful mind. Also, always create for yourself. \n Click here to read this article: https://www.thequint.com/lifestyle/bo...","date":"2017-08-31"}

Honestly a lot of the poems reminded me of short little things I would write in my journals in high school, or sort of like a Taylor Swift song. That's not really a bad thing, I actually LOVE Taylor Swift. But her songs, and these poems, aren't exactly high in literary merit. Felt very \"tumblr\"-y.","date":"2017-04-17"}
{"book_id":"1371","rating":5,"review_text":"I rank this as one of the top three books of all time, one of the greatest of all human achievements. This is one of a handful of books that I have read so often I lost count. That may sound odd if you were forced to slog through the Iliad in high school, or if you have trouble slogging through all those strange names of people from strange places. Let me see if I can explain my position. \n But first, let's put the issue of translation to rest. The most common question I hear about the Iliad is \"which translation should I read?\". The answer: it entirely depends on why you are reading it. If you are reading it because you have to, or if you are looking for excitement, and you can't abide antique phraseology or egregious rhymes, then go for the Fagles, Fitzgerald, or Lattimore. I just finished the Fagles. Sometimes, Fagles turns the tale into a real page-turner (especially toward the end). But Fagles sometimes throws in modern phrases that grate, at least for me. If you don't might high poetry and older language, check out Pope, Spencer, or Dryden. Prose translations with a more ancient feel would lead you to Dryden or Butler. If you want to feel Homer's poetry, in poetic form, without too much modernization, go with the Lattimore. I haven't read Green's translation, but his other translations (especially Herodotus) have been amazing insightful, fresh, and accurate, so I suspect it's great. Overall, for English readers coming to the Iliad for the first time, I recommend the Lattimore. He captures the underlying poetry better than anyone I have read. \n Of course, the correct answer to \"which translation\" is \"read it in the original Greek\". My introduction to Homer in the original was one of the main reasons I studied classical Greek in college. It was one reason why I majored in classical philosophy (rather than math, or physics). There is a rhythm and musicality to the original that no translation can capture, though Lattimore does the best. I just finished an essay by Stanford, from \"The Sound of Greek\", where he documents that the Greeks themselves did not read quietly to themselves, just \"for meaning\". Sound mattered. The feel of words in your mouth mattered. And, of course, the poem was originally written to be sung, not read. So, if you are reading to get into the Greek mind, there is no substitute for reading the original. \n The second most common question I get is \"should I read the Iliad or the Odyssey?\". Well, clearly you should read both! I preferred the Odyssey when I was younger. The stories are more enchanting, and there is more magic. But the older I get, the more I incline to the Iliad. The Odyssey is about family and homecoming. But the Iliad is about anger, jealousy, courage, cleverness, dedication, and mortality. My journey from returning to my home to getting closer to the end is an inclination away from the Odyssey toward the Iliad. If you are reading for adventure, go with the Odyssey. If for deeper reflection on what it means to be mortal, the Iliad. \n The most common objection I hear to the Iliad is \"all those long lists\", \"all those names\", and \"all those places\"--\"am I supposed to recognize or remember them all?\". No you aren't. Though after a few readings, \"minor\" characters become fully distinguished and vital. This time around, Ajax, Diomedes, Teucer, and Scamander meant things to me that they haven't in my many previous readings. Think of the lists of names and places like this: everyone comes from somewhere; everyone has a home; everyone has a family. Think of the sometimes long history recitations before each encounter like this: Everyone has a story to tell, and it would be a horrible loss if those stories died with them. Thinking this way made the story more immediate to me; it really drove home the loss we all suffer when a soldier dies in the field. \n The second most common objection is \"what about those crazy gods?\". I think of the gods as what we people would be like if we didn't die, and if we had everything we wanted. We would harbor grudges literally forever. We would be strong enough to do what we wanted, even when that is horrific. We would treat mere mortals as playthings. We would screw around. We would gossip. In many ways, the gods are \"smaller\" than the humans. And that is largely because we humans can choose to be magnificent. We have something to lose. \n The plot, in a nutshell, is this: a politician-general (Agamemnon) screws up by not taking good advice, causing horrific harm for his army, but refuses to accept the blame and instead lashes out at his best soldier (Achilleus), insulting him and taking away something he loves. The soldier, in his wrath, withdraws from the fight, and all hell breaks lose. The killing cascades as hero after hero takes revenge for another hero's death. Anger boils over within everyone, even the gods. It looks like there is no end, until a loyal patriot (Hector) kills someone Achilleus loves (Patroclus), which brings Achilleus back into the fight, for revenge. The story ends with a massive memorial, and the personal reconciliation of a father (Prium) with his son's killer. \n The language is graphic and riveting (once you get past the lists). I would hope this is a story you will never forget, even if you forget specific names and places.","date":"2017-05-29"}

{"book_id":"22151696","rating":3,"review_text":"\"There is a certain quality to words that--when strung in a certain way--has an almost hypnotic effect.\" \n Lullabies was my second poetry read by Lang Leav, and save for a handful of excerpts, I was a bit let down. From what I recall of The Universe of Us, it was an enchanting collection with a number of gems thrown in for good measure. \n But the poems in this one, especially the few that tried to come of as witty or rhythmic, were puzzling and perplexing and just why.... Leav tries to tackle down poems \"of hope and ecstasy, of tenderness and betrayal,\" but in the end I was just left with little to no emotions. However, I did love the splendid illustrations featured in here: \n And so instead of focusing on those aforementioned nonsensical pieces, I decided to share those rare quotes and poems that captured my heart for a hot minute: \n Patience \n \"Patience and Love agreed to meet at a set time and place; beneath the twenty-third tree in the olive orchard. Patience arrived promptly and waited. She checked her watch every so often but still, there was no sign of Love. \n Was it the twenty-third tree or the fifty-sixth? She wondered and decided to check, just in case. As she made her way over to the fifty-sixth tree, Love arrived at twenty-three, where Patience was noticeably absent. \n Love waited and waited before deciding he must have the wrong tree and perhaps it was another where they were supposed to meet. \n Meanwhile, Patience had arrived at the fifty-sixth tree, where Love was still nowhere to be seen. \n Both begin to drift aimlessly around the olive orchard, almost meeting but never do. \n Finally, Patience, who was feeling lost and resigned, found herself beneath the same tree where she began. She stood there for barely a minute when there was a tap on her shoulder. \n It was Love. \n .................................. \n \"Where are you?\" She asked. \"I have been searching all my life.\" \n \"Stop looking for me,\" Love replied, \"and I will find you.\" \n Little tales like the above ones are my Achilles' heel. \n And/Or \n \"I wanted everything because I didn't want anything enough.\" \n Message in a Bottle \n \"We can't see ourselves the way others see us.\" \n This piece me think a lot on whether that's a good or bad thing. I'm still contemplating. \n That Night \n \"It was one of those nights that you are not altogether sure really did happen. There are no photographs, no receipts, no scrawled journal entries.\" \n Three Questions \n \"What was it like to love him? asked Gratitude. \n It was like being exhumed, I answered. And brought to life in a flash of brilliance. \n What was it like to be loved in return? asked Joy. \n It was like being seen after a perpetual darkness, I replied. To be heard after a lifetime of silence. \n What was it like to lose him? asked Sorrow. \n There was a long pause before I responded: \n It was like hearing every good-bye ever said to me--said all at once.\" \n Poker Face \n \"There was a time I would tell you, \n of all that ached inside; \n the things I held so sacred, \n to all the world I'd hide. \n But they became your weapons, \n and slowly I have learnt, \n the less that is said, the better-- \n the lesser I'll be hurt. \n Of all you've used against me, \n the worst has been my words. \n There are things I'll never tell you, \n and it is sad to think it so; \n the more you come to know me-- \n the less of me you'll know.\" \n This haunting poem remains my favorite one. It was worth going through all of it, just to find this one shining gem. \n Remembering You \n \"The day you left, I went through all my old journals, frantically looking for the first mention of you. Searching for any details I can no longer recall--any morsel of information that may have been lost to my subconscious. The memory of you is fading, a little at a time, and I can feel myself forgetting. I don't want to forget.\" \n A Ghost \n \"Strange how it mattered so much, \n when now it matters \n so little.\" \n Overall, since my expectations were lower than low, Lullabies was a lot better than I was anticipating. It managed to hit my heart in a couple of places, so I'm glad I gave it my best shot. \n Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":4,"review_text":"Told through vivid poems, Jacqueline Woodson shares what it was like to grow up as an African American in the 1960s and 1970s.

If you like to read things that make you stop and think because they resonate with you or feel authentic, I think you'll enjoy this. Would I, in my very limited experience with poetry, say Rupi Kaur is a good poet? Yes. Would one of my poetry instructors from college say the same? I'm not sure.

I've bookmarked several pages and highlighted what's remaining. I've read them so many times, I can eloquently quote the book.

{"book_id":"18263725","rating":2,"review_text":"For more of my reviews, visit www.litlaughlearn.com \n The Crossover by Kwame Alexander \n The Crossover is a realistic fiction told in verse about twin brothers Josh and Jordan who both play basketball. When one of them gets a girlfriend, the two slowly grow apart. Add to that their dad's health problems, and Josh is having a lot of trouble, it even starts interrupting his A-game on the basketball court. Josh takes it out in his rhymes (which are the vehicle of this story). \n I liked the storyline and the fact that the boys are African Americans and not portrayed as ghetto or trouble makers. I liked that it shows different things that teen boys are asked to balance in their life and how that causes a lot of stress for them. I like that the message is that you don't have to win a ball game and life is not just about that. I like that the book has supportive parents who are involved in the kids' lives and don't just magically drop away like most juvenile fiction books. \n What I don't like is probably the reason it won the Newbery Medal. I didn't like the verse. Yes, you heard me right. I didn't think it sounded authentic. It sounded like an adult trying to write kid poetry and making it badly. We shouldn't assume that kids write poetry badly because they aren't adults. I didn't the like the poems. It was more like they took the actual story and just put in random line breaks. I did like the use of the vocabulary words and definitions and how Josh applies the words to his life. \n Tags: realistic fiction, novels in verse, basketball, brothers, health problems, multicultural, family relations","date":"2016-04-18"}

Those letters were among a few things remained in my exhausted mind that night. These days, overwhelmed with all the Tao, Wabisabi, Minimalism, I picked the book as a short break from all those heavy-philosophical stuffs. It was a great surprise. It feels like a long-lost friend sitting down beside and sharing about all the questions which have haunted me for the past 6 months - the question about knowing, love, solitude and fear of uncertainty. The letters were like a nice closing for that restless search, partly connecting all the fragmented answers which I got here and there. \n And, all those were delivered in a very comforting language. :) \n *About fear: \"Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love.\" \n *About the doubt on knowing: \"\"I beg you, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.\" \n *About love: \"And this more human love, which will be carried out with infinite consideration and gentleness and will be good and clean in its tyings and untyings, will be like that love which we are straining and toiling to prepare, the love which consists in this, that two lonely beings protect one another, border upon one another and greet one another.\" \n *About solitude: \"[A]t bottom, and just in the deepest and most important things, we are unutterably alone, and for one person to be able to advise or even help another, a lot must happen, a lot must go well, a whole constellation of things must come right in order once to succeed.\" \n ...","date":"2016-06-28"}

{"book_id":"15645","rating":3,"review_text":"On my trip to Italy I was able to re-read Dante's Inferno. I was struck by how he cleverly inserts his enemies and contemporary villains into the epic. Also, I cannot help but wonder if the ingenious torments he comes up for each sin are original with Dante. Of course, I love it that Dante doesn't hesitate to place Popes in various circles of Hell. The way he and Virgil have to dodge demons makes the trip an exciting adventure. I must admit I fully enjoyed this version by Charles Eliot Norton with the explanatory notes. I did want to add ...Fierce rivalries often split the dominant faction. So in 1302 the __Black__ Guelfs, in alliance with Pope Boniface VIII, succeeded in expelling the __Whites.__ Among the White Guelfs at this time was Dante (1265__1321), who had held public office. Doomed to spend the rest of his life in exile, he wrote the Divine Comedy while in exile. So, Dante puts Popes Nicholas, Boniface and Clement in the 8th and 9th circles of hell for fraud.

I found this poem very entertaining and very lighthearted compared to Eliot's other works such as the \"Wasteland\" and \"The Song of J Alfred Prufrock.\" Eliot is quite negative towards the Chinese in these poems and I will have to do some more research into the reasoning. He shows definite resentment. While there seems to be no accusations of anti Chinese sentiment there have been both accusations and defense of accusations of anti-semitism. It is quite possible he was just using current language of the day.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"This book is raw, it's honest, it's aching, and it's beautiful. \n But mostly, Milk and Honey is brave. \n I didn't anticipate the effect it would have on me. I sat down to read during breakfast one morning a couple weeks ago, and my oatmeal went cold. It wasn't that I was so enamored with the poetry, although the words are stunning. But the first section - the hurting - brought up some things that I've never been comfortable thinking about, let alone lingering on over a cup of coffee. It hit me a little hard. I set Milk and Honey aside for a couple weeks after that, needing time before I could turn back to it. \n The other three sections weren't quite so difficult. I read them in a few days. The loving and breaking parts were emotional and real, and the healing section was optimistic and hopeful without tipping into saccharine. But I find myself constantly thinking back on that first section, and marveling at Kaur's courage in putting it out in the world. I only hope to be as brave one day. She makes me think it's possible. \n This book is immensely important, but as to why it's important, I think that will vary from person to person. Those struggling to love themselves may find acceptance in the poems addressing body image and confidence. Anyone dealing with loss could find hope in the healing section. It may help the heartbroken pull through. Women will find strength and men will find understanding. \n Every person needs to read something like Milk and Honey in their lives.","date":"2016-06-23"}

{"book_id":"18263725","rating":5,"review_text":"This is a book I already have in my classroom library, but I hadn't read it--I bought it from Scholastic because I have a lot of kids who love basketball but very definitely do not love reading. If you have kids like that, give them this book. \n Told in first person from the perspective of 12 year old Josh Bell, The Crossover traces his relationships with his twin brother, his former basketball star father, and basketball as the county championship rapidly approaches. Josh's twin brother, Jordan, is starting to have other priorities than basketball, his father's health seems to be declining, and for the first time, Josh finds himself having to deal with things alone. Josh's bewilderment at his brother no longer wanting to do everything with Josh feels authentic, and just this element of the story alone perfectly captures the capriciousness of middle school friendships--and the anger and confusion of the person left behind. \n The most interesting part of the book is its format. It's written in verse, which is very much in line with Josh's love of rap music. This format gives the story an immediacy and honesty that really allowed me to connect to and care about the characters; it felt like I was reading diary entries. The format also enables the book to play with time, since many of the poems can be stand-alone, and the time elapsed between poems ranges from seconds to weeks. Sometimes the poems are in the form of text messages; sometimes they're conversations; sometimes they're Josh's father's basketball rules. This flexibility adds to the feeling that you're in Josh's head: you're feeling time as he feels it. Telling a basketball story in verse is also extremely appropriate given the movement and flow of a basketball game. I often hear people who love basketball, but are otherwise not really sports fans, compare it to poetry or dancing. There is a clear poetry in the repeated image of Josh practicing free throws over and over again, trying to get to his dad's record of fifty baskets in a row. The poetry also adds to the surrealness and lack of structure of Josh's experiences; by the end of the book, his world is very different. \n I would use this and Brown Girl Dreaming in a unit on poetry. They both use poetry in a similar narrative function, but the structure of the poems themselves are different. As books, they're also similar and different enough to generate a great deal of discussion and exploration. I would love to read essays comparing and contrasting both books. I also think it'd be really interesting to use both books in reading groups--maybe with another book or two written in a similar style--so groups could periodically share small projects and presentations with each other. Both books could work nicely with 8th grade Social Studies, as part of the Civil Rights unit. (Or even 5th, although I'm not sure how far into U.S. History the 5th grade curriculum goes.) \n AR Information: \n Quiz #: 164734 \n Level: 4.3 \n Points: 2","date":"2016-01-30"}

{"book_id":"45974","rating":5,"review_text":"\"To fight is proof of one's inability to do battle with oneself.\" \n Fernando Pessoa is a writer of great genius and invention. He has the ability to uniquely philosophise about life, from the unique extremes of one man's isolation and disconnection with the world, to more populous ideas that any soul can relate to. In fact given enough thought, anyone can relate to the beautiful and elegant reasoning and anti-reasoning Pessoa has about life and death. \n Bernardo Soares is the main character, but Pessoa himself admits that much of what his character sees and feels of the world, is an extension of himself and his own outlook of the world, even though through the medium of literature, those truths and observations made of the world can sometimes be amplified and temper the truths with an acute anonymity, so that he might read his passages in some future date and wonder what poor and lonely soul could have written such morbid fantasises and witless observations about a world that is at times so unnervingly beautiful. \n And so how can I review this book? Can I give you a plot to consider, or a description of a character to muse over? No, I can't really give you any of these things, as like Agua Viva by Clarice Lispector, this book is in the same kind of vein, of what some might describe as being existentialist literature, a stream of consciousness that philosophises about everything, but does so at a level beyond common thought and rationality. \n The Book of Disquiet is like a diary of a withering soul, pragmatically filling in the discourse of life and death, and Pessoa does so with wonderful use of language and endlessly quotable lines, and I can only imagine this holds up well thanks to the wonderful translation. The creative reinventions of the same ideas are reconstituted in the package of a genius at play in words, and through them we view different angles of a single consciousness. But the text never becomes dull or trite, and one can feel Pessoa's conscience is an endless river of wisdom fighting against the sea of life: on which Pessoa said himself - \"How often my ordinary consciousness of myself is obscured by the dark sediment stirred up in some stagnant part of me.\" \n I believe he is referring to life and death, and how those two poles stir up sediment in all of us, until we are unsure of seeing anything clearly at all.","date":"2017-01-02"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"I wrote a review last night, but it disappeared, so let's try this again. \n There's no doubt that Ms. Kaur has overcome a lot in her years and her writing does pack a bit of a punch. But, I found that her style was a little shallow and distracting at times. Let me elaborate. \n The first section was the worst, involving graphic details of being abused and molested by strangers and extended family members. This was triggering to the point that I needed to take actions to calm down before sleeping. Yet further into the book, she discusses love and desire. She speaks in metaphors about masturbation, setting the world on fire with lust, using tongues to write poetry between the legs, etc. Even her line drawings were somewhat graphic in places, like fingers dripping with honey. But then when the f word finally makes an appearance, she blocks it out with ****. I found that to be rather odd, but I accepted it and moved on. \n Her actual writing style doesn't include capitalization, punctuation other than periods, or even strategic line breaks where pauses would be found. I found it difficult to follow some of her poems at times because of this. But then her poems were either too complicated that it took some time to decipher the actual meaning behind it, or I just didn't get them entirely. There were maybe 2 that were like that. The rest were almost too simple. I often find that poems that can have more than one meaning, depending on how the reader interprets it, is more powerful that a shallow line that says only one thing with no other depth or nuance to it. \n She tended to overuse metaphors, like setting something on fire with anger or passion, and it seemed like she included too many references to honey just for the sake of tying in with the title. \n Again, this book was good, but it was fantastic, and I wasn't blown away by it, but considering her heritage as a Punjabi woman and that she's set out on her own and made a life for herself is inspiring enough, especially if what she wrote was common for Punjabi families. \n Bottom line is that her words were shallow and often contradictory, but powerful enough to send one pointed message.","date":"2016-08-29"}

{"book_id":"19351","rating":3,"review_text":"3.5 \n Esta es una lectura que solo se disfruta si de verdad se esta interesado en ella. No creo que nadie, leyendo por obligacion, es decir como lectura escolar/universitaria, o algo asi, pueda disfrutarla y entenderla como se debe. \n Para mi, que disfruto los clasicos, El Poema de Gilgamesh era un must. Es basicamente la obra epica mas antigua de la cual se tenga conocimiento. Es la \"madre\" de las obras epicas por asi decirlo. \n La historia relata la vida de Gilgamesh, un Rey tiranico de Uruk, ciudad donde vivia, que gobernaba a su antojo. Tras las plegarias de los plebeyos, los dioses crean entonces a Enkidu, quien en principio estaria destinado a enfrentarse a Gilgamesh para destruirlo. Sin embargo, por diversas circunstancias, ambos terminan haciendose amigos, lo cual era totalmente lo contrario al plan de los dioses. El punto central del poema en si, es que debido a una serie de eventos ocurridos a Gilgamesh, este decide emprender un viaje en busca de la inmortalidad. \n Debo admitir que, lei la version normal, reconstruida a partir de las tablillas, por lo tanto la historia tenia fragmentos que faltaban, lo cual me dificultaba muchisimo la lectura y su comprension. Yo soy de las personas que me gusta ver primero la version original ante todo, aunque posteriormente lea una version nueva. Por lo tanto, es posible que si hubiese leido una version reconstruida mas moderna, hubiese disfrutado mas la historia, sin embargo la esencia no hubiese sido la misma, y para mi, eso cuenta muchisimo. \n Independientemente de todo esto, creo que El Poema de Gilgamesh es sin duda una obra de tremendo valor, no solo por su importancia historica, sino porque en si, la forma en que esta escrita, es en mi opinion personal, una obra de arte que no puede ser valorada ni comparada con cualquier cosa. La historia en si es sencilla, nada muy elaborado ni dificil de comprender.","date":"2016-04-20"}
{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"Oh why did I bother reading it? I came here after reading The Princess Saves Herself in this One, which was a complete disappointment. Many reviewers recommended Milk and Honey instead. I found it even worse. \n Maybe I'm too old to enjoy this kind of \"poems\". But then again, I don't think 15 or 20 year-old me would have enjoyed them either. I guess they're just not aimed at me. At least with The princess..., I was able to resonate with a couple of poems about grief. Milk and Honey was just 3edgy5me. I don't even know what annoyed me more. The fact that a lot of serious themes are romanticized and turned into emo confessions. The author's way of viewing sex and relationships - I could not connect with anything at all. The fact that other subjects are taken out of proportion (seriously, how many poems about leg hair can you write? I got it the first time. Why include so many in a single book?!) Oooor... \n The bloody style in which these are written. \n It's just so \n t u m b l r a e s t h e t i c. \n Take out the drawings, use caps at the beginning of sentences, eliminate all those useless enters after only 1-2 words, eliminate the page breaks and let this flow like normal prose. You get an angsty girl diary full of platitudes. There's just no subtlety about it. No poem that gives you that \"aha!\" feeling. No poem that makes you think about it once you close the book. \n Or maybe it's just me. \n Maybe I'm just a cynical asshole. \n But I've learned nothing from this book. \n And I couldn't help but grit my teeth at how preachy the last part is. \n Oh, the wise woman who's suffered offered her free advice to me, stemming from the depth of her pinterest self help posts soul. \n Thanks but no thanks.","date":"2017-09-05"}

{"book_id":"45974","rating":5,"review_text":"Quite simply, one of the best books I've ever read. From page one I knew it. I almost knew it from the moment I picked it up, before I even read. \n The book, made up of over four hundred small chapters (whose order no-one can quite be sure of), was found in a trunk after Pessoa died, as well as bits and bobs scrawled on a series of letters, barmats, bills, receipts and whatever else he could get his hands on when inspiration struck. \n Nominally, the book contains the thoughts of a clerk working in Lisbon. These thoughts, though, are largely very precise, inward-looking examinations of what it feels like to be alive, to be human. They are unflinching descriptions of mental processes and life impressions which appear on the page like your own innermost thoughts, at other times like dream statements, at others like hearing someone's mind talking to you just before sleep. \n The book is hugely depressing and great fun. It is a wonderful antidote to the inspirational quote crew - and the whole \"happy ending\" culture which sometimes seems overwhelming. Why do we not want to see the reality of life as it really is? \n Pessoa, like DH Lawrence, could write a shopping list and it would make great reading. Pessoa is a great thinker, though, and intelligent, and as dedicated to his work as any saint or sportsperson ever was. Indeed, this book reminded me of a religious text at times, Zen-like, Tao-ist, in its riddles and contradictions and topsy-turvy demonstration of everything being nothing, yet nothing being everything. \n Usually a good book provides a couple of decent quotes but this one could be quoted almost in its entirety. It's an absolute masterpiece. A work of such humanity that it is damn near human, with all the contradictions, frustrations and baffling determination to understand a universe which can never be understood, that entails.","date":"2017-08-30"}
{"book_id":"82356","rating":4,"review_text":"I had problems with this one. I read it as part of a reading group here on Good Reads and for quite some time thought I was going to have to give up. I could see the humour, just, but the play struck me as absurd (not in a good way) and, sadly, not funny. But then I chanced upon a production made a few years ago at the Globe Theatre in London (and available to rent or download from their Globe Player on the website) and in one morning was converted. This is a fresh, funny play - ridiculous but good natured, witty and fast, stupid but serious and well worth the time and effort to have a look at. If, like me, the text alone - and study notes - plain old words, basically - proves either confusing or uninspiring, it is well worth seeking out and investing in the Globe production. I don't work for the Globe and have never been there but I can't overstate how much watching that version of the play helped me to unlock and enjoy Shakespeare's text.","date":"2016-09-28"}

I guess I'll just mention some stuff I liked. I appreciated how it started with a very strong emotional punch and ended on a hopeful, happier note. The writing was beautiful yet very simplistic. The small hints of the author's views on feminism towards the end were nice without feeling preachy or too loud, if that makes sense. In general, I appreciated that this book made me feel both sad and happy in only a few pages and I would definitely read anything else Rupi Kaur writes.

{"book_id":"5932","rating":3,"review_text":"Este libro, mas que de amor, habla es de pasiones fugaces y amantes secretas, y el dolor que puede ocasionar el mismo, mucho mas duradero que la misma relacion. En estos 20 poemas Pablo no nos describe una sola mujer, el evoca todos sus amores y companeras de delirio o arrebato de su pasado, logrando plasmar en papel y tinta el sentimiento de un amor lejano, vivido, disfrutado, y que, tal vez, aun lastima. Esa herida abierta que todavia no se esta muy seguro si ha cerrado. \n Algunos de los poemas que me lograron conmover verdaderamente fueron, <<Te recuerdo como eras>> y <<Hemos perdido aun>> enuncian el recuerdo de una mujer lejana y distante. <<Para mi corazon>> comenta de los amores que te dejan fluir y en vez de oprimir, liberan y <<Puedo escribir los versos>> enuncia el final de una relacion, esa astilla constante para el alma y su ultimo soplo de inspiracion. \n Realmente es muy hermoso como un hombre puede transformar un verdadero sentimiento en palabras (a pesar de que era mujeriego) y hacernos sentir sus desventuras, agravios y hasta satisfacciones. Ademas, la riqueza de sus comparaciones y sus versos, es escultural. \n En su poema No. XII esta mi verso favorito que dice: \n <<Para mi corazon basta tu pecho, \n para tu libertad bastan mis alas. \n Desde mi boca llegara hasta el cielo, \n lo que estaba dormido sobre tu alma>> (Neruda, 1924: 61).","date":"2016-05-13"}
{"book_id":"406373","rating":5,"review_text":"Es una obra escrita enteramente en dialogos, que esta divida en dos partes muy dramaticas, denominadas, \"Fausto: Primera parte de la tragedia\" y \"Fausto: Segunda parte de la tragedia\". \n En su primera parte, publicada en el ano 1808, Dios hace una apuesta con Mefistofeles (el Diablo) quien dice poder descarriar el alma de Fausto, el alma favorita de Dios, este acepta la apuesta. \n <<Al vivir, deja vivir>> (Goethe, 1808, p.5). \n Fausto es un erudito muy recorrido, considerando suicidarse al pensar que habia llegado al tope de su conocimiento, cuando conoce a Mefistofeles, este le ofrece todos los placeres y conocimientos del mundo a cambio de su alma y Fausto en un inicio piensa denegar su propuesta al creer que ya no habia mas nada escondido, el Diablo logra convencerlo y demostrarle que esta equivocado, este finalmente acepta. Luego ocurren otros acontecimientos y es cuando conoce a Margarita, en el idioma original Gretchen, Fausto se enamora de una manera loca y cegada de ella, y el sentimiento es reciproco. \n << !Es la mas bella imagen de mujer! \n ?Cabe que la mujer sea tan bella? \n En este cuerpo, que aqui esta extendido, \n ?Debo ver el resumen de los cielos? \n ?Se halla en el mundo cosa semejante? >> \n (Goethe, 1808, p.71). \n Margarita le da un sedante a su madre para poder tener intimidad con Fausto, sedante que le da Mefistofeles a el para la ocasion, y este causa la muerte de la madre de Margarita, luego de esa noche ella queda embarazada y pierde a su hermano tras el enfrentarse con Fausto en un duelo. Fausto se va destrozado y cuando regresa Margarita se encuentra en la carcel tras haber cometido infanticidio, por matar a su hijo, y una locura mental severa, Fausto le ruego que ella escape con el, pero se niega tras rogarle que la deje morir ahi por sus pecados. Y culmina la primera parte de la tragedia. \n << Cuando un imbecil no ve la salida, \n se imagina que todo ha concluido. \n !Solo vive quien no pierde el valor! \n Y tu ya estas bastante endemoniado. \n No hay en el mundo cosa mas ridicula \n que un demonio en la desesperacion. >> \n (Goethe, 1808, p.98). \n Como podemos entender, la primera parte se trata mas de la necesidad de Fausto y el amor por algo real, algo que el pueda sentir, su instinto e inclinaciones. Como se ve tentado por el pecado, cuando la diferencia de lo bendito y lo benigno tiende de un hilo, Goethe hace referencia a todos los seres humanos que nos vemos llevados por el momento y las tentaciones diarias a la que es sometida el mismo, y como la redencion puede ser, de una manera muy distinta, nuestro punto del paroxismo. \n El descenso al infierno es facil, como muy bien lo sabe Fausto. Tras toda una vida de lucha, solo necesita de unos cuantos dias y una lengua manipuladora (Mefistofeles) para caer de llano en el piso y disfrutar de su tropiezo. \n La segunda parte de la tragedia se centra mas en el deseo y la necesidad de poder de Fausto, ya ha superado a Margarita y ahora solo quiere ganar y encontrar paz, este tras participar y ayudar a ganar una batalla, se le obsequian tierras en donde pertenecera infeliz por no poder ser el dueno total de la extension. Esta parte se caracteriza mas por dar sus opiniones historicas, filosoficas y politicas. Fue publicada en el ano 1832, epoca que resulta ser el mismo ano en que murio Johann W. Goethe. \n Fausto de Goethe es un obra fantastica, impresionante en escalas abrumadoras y, sin mas que decir, eterea; es de entender, el por que me sobrepasa por completo. \n <<No esta mudo este mundo ante el que es digno...>> \n (Goethe, 1832, p.336.).","date":"2016-03-26"}

Read the Mandelbaum translation this time, but couldn't find it in the ISBNs and was lazy. Very similar to Fitzgerald's, in most ways.","date":"2016-09-28"}
{"book_id":"20613761","rating":5,"review_text":"I've been meaning to read this for awhile. Part poetry, part journalism, part memoir, part visual -- what a fascinating and compelling read. I did read it in one sitting, and kind of wish I had taken more time with it. Rankine's short pieces, often slaps of memoir or vignettes, combine to make a powerful and enlightening picture of her life as an academic and thoughtful observer and participant in our society, suffering from the oppression and racism that is constant and innate to our society. A partner to _Between the World and Me_, without a doubt, but different in the personal and poetic, as well. Her essay about Serena Williams was masterful and probably my favorite part, as in that one setting I could chew on a non-fiction essay perhaps better than some of the shorter, more poetic vignettes. But I keep thinking about this line: \"your body running off each undesired desired encounter\" (79). Rankine's desire for connection and inclusion, and her constant feeling of exclusion and avoidance, was powerfully demonstrated. A very very good read. Highly teachable, if you think that way.","date":"2016-08-11"}

However, this is dense food and I think that I need to both see the performance and reread to appreciate it even more, and it might not have been the ideal meal for a bad day -- oh well. I was prepared for the piece to be more about race than feminism, and even though it definitely deals with the intersection of those two ideas, it is so much more about feminism. Painfully so. How does a woman define herself, when her gender and her race identities demand so much without allowing her freedom to decide, move, or flex? \"i'm finally bein real / no longer symmetrical & impervious to pain,\" says the lady in purple, and I doubt there's a woman (or man) alive who wouldn't understand that comment.

{"book_id":"91571","rating":5,"review_text":"I think I adore the Shakespeare's problem plays. This one was fascinating. Religion, justice, sex, and disguises -- even the classic bed trick. Many people seem to hate this one, and I can see why. Isabella would rather keep her chastity than save her brother's life. The duke absconds from all responsibility (foreshadowing Prospero?) but then attempts to manage everything he abandoned. Vienna is rotten and cannot be fixed by normal means. The religious aspect of the whole thing particularly fascinated me, especially the rigidity of both Isabella's and Angelo's forms of morality. The whole thing just felt familiar, I guess -- the issues ones that I have seen and grappled with, on a much more mundane scale. I will reread and reread this one, just as I gravitate to _All's Well That Ends Well_, that other wackidoodle. Morality must be contextual, I think.","date":"2016-03-29"}

It's such an eloquent way of describing the human fear of being irrelevant and wasting time on Earth, it shook me. Everyone is talking about CITIZEN, I'm late to the party but I agree with all that's been said. So much power is wrapped into these little vignettes and while I didn't understand all of it, what I was able to grasp was incredibly moving. It was also a relief to read in a review that the scripts were for videos you're supposed to Google, until I read that I could not figure out why those were inserted. \n This book is unfortunately timeless as of today, even for me, most of the microaggressions mentioned within its pages were shocking. Some of them were so blatant I wonder how many subtle discriminatory remarks or looks have been made against me or my siblings or parents that I haven't noticed. Thus I view this is a wakeup call or gentle reminder to those of us who tend to close our eyes to prejudice in order to get by, or have become so oblivious. And I had no idea how much discrimination Serena Williams faced in the early aughts from other players, spectators and tennis officials until I first read this excerpt in the NYT. I also appreciated that Rankine set most of her poems in the world of the professional Black class, so that people can see that racism often transcends class. That being in a wealthier setting does not exclude you from racism from the ignorant or the \"good people\". \n \"A friend argues that Americans battle between the 'historical self' and the 'self self.' By this she means you mostly interact as friends with mutual interest and, for the most part, compatible personalities; however, sometimes your historical selves, her white self and your black self, or your white self and her black self, arrive with the full force of your American positioning. Then you are standing face-to-face in seconds that wipe the affable smiles right from your mouths. What did you say? Instantaneously your attachment seems fragile, tenuous, subject to any transgression of your historical self. And though your joined personal histories are supposed to save you from misunderstandings, they usually cause you to understand all too what well is meant\" (14) \n \"And you are not the guy and still you fit the description because there is only one guy who is always the guy fitting the description\" (105)","date":"2016-04-10"}

{"book_id":"253264","rating":3,"review_text":"3.5 stars. A melodramatic, but fun spectacle -- often an odd amalgamation of 50s Americana (the aw-shucks-gee-wiz kid Howard) and subversive radical politics that is always cloaked in easily-digestible doses for middle America, and then ultimately dismissed (in the form of the Twainsian reporter). In many ways, it's a quintessential American play: loud, bombastic, entertaining, in-your-face, and just made to be transformed into a Hollywood screenplay, which it was in 1960. I loved the movie when I was younger because it espoused a viewpoint with which I thought I agreed. However, reading the play a little more objectively now years later, I find it to be cheesy and preachy. The ultimate message : \"It doesn't matter if evolution is evil or not, everyone is entitled to an opinion!\" But...it actually DOES matter. Facts matter. But the wishy-washy ending throws out that \"cynical\" take in favor of the conclusion that everyone is entitled to an opinion, even if it's wrong -- a sentiment spoken directly by Drummond. To actually suggest that facts matter, as the reporter Hornbeck does, is to be too \"cynical.\" It's a compromise intended to gain mass appeal from audiences. (Or is that opinion too cynical?) \n In other countries where topics like evolution are just a fact that any rational, educated adult understands, this play probably seems pretty wild. I find it a little sad that we need such a play in the United States because characters like Brady and Rev. Brown actual exist and have large followings to this day. I also wish that Inherit the Wind had been a little less ham-fisted in its sensationalism. Certainly, the Scopes Monkey Trial was just that, but as Lawrence writes in his preface, this is drama, where we don't have to stick to historical accuracy. I enjoyed Inherit the Wind, but I would have enjoyed it even more if we had been presented a more balanced, philosophical discussion rather than a mimicking of the outrageous, if historically-accurate, \"circus\" atmosphere (to quote a word from the play) that such issues inevitable take in the United States, whether in our trials or on our stage. And I would have preferred if the conclusion had resisted the safe and (ch)easy \"can't we all just get along\" ending.","date":"2017-05-07"}
{"book_id":"20613761","rating":5,"review_text":"Rankine's book of poems, essays, and artwork is an instant classic that strikes at the heart of current racial injustice in the United States. Topics include Hurricane Katrina, the Jena Six, and Trayvon Martin (as well as a host of other innocent murder victims). We also get commentary on Serena Williams as an example of blackness in a white world and the infamous Zidane headbutt. Interspaced with these major topics are deeply personal instances of the poet experiencing moments of prejudice on an everyday level. Rankine is a master of form, flawlessly weaving prose poetry, free verse, essays, quotations, and the artwork of others to not only provide context, but also to layer meaning. Zidane (both images and quotations from the soccer player) is in conversation with James Baldwin. Comments from CNN anchors are in conversation with the black bodies they objectify for television audiences. And the poet is in conversation with them all, including those people encountered on a daily basis, giving voice to ideas often left unsaid in the heat of the moment. \n Rankine's poetry illuminates both the outer struggle against systemic racism (which all-too-often culminates in violence against black bodies), and also the inner, personal struggle to cope with that reality (which often requires a suppression of the desire to violently lash out at the system, as well as those who inhabit it, who are sometimes not even conscious of that knowledge). It's an unforgettable book that I highly recommend.","date":"2016-12-07"}
{"book_id":"27822","rating":5,"review_text":"Pushkin's novel in verse Eugene Onegin is something like the Russian National Epic. I don't know why. It's not that it is a bad book, it is excellent and highly readable (a veritable page-turner), it's just that it is kind of elitist. It is full of references to classical mythology and to literature. You would need to be an expert on Russian, French, and English lit to catch half the allusions. When Vladimir Nabokov translated it, the annotations were five times longer than the poem. [a story recounted in Alex Beam's forthcoming THE FEUD. Reading THE FEUD made me want to read Onegin]. The story in the poem is almost non-existent: girl meets boy, boy is a jerk, many hearts are broken. However, it is the construction of the thing, and the verse, which is said to be spellbinding in the original Russian, that make the poem so memorable. My Russian, which faded decades ago, is restricted to hello, how are you?, and I have a cat; I will not be reading it in Russian. Reading Babette Deutsch's old translation only makes me want to read as many translations as I can, even the dreaded Nabokov one. Eugene Onegin is a book I will read again and again.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"I gave this book five stars, yes, but with it comes this fair warning: I am a deeply emotional person. By that I don't mean to say that my emotions are easily moved or manipulated by things external to my being, but merely - and more basically, I think - that a bunch of words strung together (with the end purpose of evoking feelings of longing or reflection or what have you when it comes to topics of love or existence) can make me feel shit. And, in that way, my judgment of this book and its poems becomes skewed by emotion rather than by an actually fair assessment of the quality of the work itself. \n Yes. The poems are simplistic - really to the point at which they risk falling over the edge and into a hole of bullshit. You'll find yourself constantly thinking \"well, fuck, I could've written this overly emotionally exaggerated sentence broken up into three lines - shit\" (or, at least, I certainly did). But I do think there's merit in a six-word, two-lined poem that can evoke a memory or an idealized notion accompanied by a corresponding emotion or set of emotions. \n So, sure, her shit is \"rudimentary\" or whatever, but that doesn't make them not good.","date":"2016-12-24"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"I'd first come across a poem of Rupi Kaur's online and thought it was really lovely, and kind of impulse-bought this collection. A few months later I read an article stating that other authors were very frustrated by her rise to relative fame as she had apparently capitalized on her social media following to do as well as she did-- it was a harsh critique of her poetry and how she became successful. I was therefore a little hesitant to start this collection. \n I'm not very adept in reading poetry, and often I'm not able to understand or get through works of poetry. I did not have that issue at all with these very loose-form, very brief works. I read it all in one evening! I've read some critiques on this site stating that her ideas in this collection are not particularly new or novel, and while I agree with that, I really did find this collection beautiful and relatable and would definitely recommend to others. But maybe only others like me, who often have trouble with poetry.","date":"2017-08-28"}
{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"This collection of poetry has sky-rocketed in the past year. So, as a person who is an avid reader of poetry and is open to trying the most obscure poets as well as the most popular, I decided to pick up this collection to see what it was all about. \n The first thing I noticed was the style in which it is written. The style is very short, free-verse poetry that tends to have one or two very impactful lines within the poem. For example, here is one of the poems from the collection that I particularly liked: \n your name is \n the strongest \n positive and negative \n connotation in any language \n it lights me up or \n leaves me aching for days \n -rupi kaur \n Now, many people (more specifically, avid poetry readers, especially those who pride themselves on reading the greatest names in poetry) would say this is not poetry. That it's 'hipster' poetry for teenage girls. \n I, as a reader of all types of poetry, having studied poetry as an English major at the previous university I attended as well as one I attended abroad (which was one of the top in the UK) strongly disagree with this. I have read the greats and have appreciated them just as much as I appreciated this collection of poetry. \n Why? \n Because unlike poets such as Yeats, Dickinson, Whitman, Frost, and Keats, this collection by Rupi Kaur is, in a word, accessible. \n It is accessible to ALL readers and allows readers who are not as familiar with poetry to read and enjoy this. It opens up a whole new world of reading to them, and maybe somewhere down the line in their new journey of poetry reading they will reach the greats and appreciate them as well. \n Moving on from the above discussion, I would like to discuss why I enjoyed the content of this collection. \n Kaur has an innate talent of packing a big punch in very short poems. This is not an easy feat. To find the words, and so very few at that, that will make a person look up from the book and think \"Wow. This is incredibly true and incredibly raw,\" is a huge accomplishment. Not only that, but the author tackles subjects that are very touchy, such as rape. She does it in such a way that makes you want to stand up and join all of those women that were marching this past weekend and protect those who have gone through such horrendous, disgusting ordeals (women and men alike). Her poetry is empowering and puts a lot of thoughts and feelings thousands of people have stuck inside their heads onto paper for all to read and all to understand. \n All of this is not to say that this is a perfect collection of poetry. There were some poems that didn't hit home as much as they were intended to. There were some that could have been left out of the book and not have downgraded the collection by any means. However, that being said, I did still enjoy reading every poem in this collection. \n The main reason I enjoyed this was because it did something for me, and I'm sure for many other avid poetry readers, that no other collection has done before: it has opened poetry up to the world again. It has made poetry more popular, and it has made poetry a genre that more people are seeking out. For that, I am grateful for this collection. \n Overall rating: 4/5 stars","date":"2016-10-15"}

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":5,"review_text":"It's astonishing that a painful look at the ugliness of racism can create something beautiful. Citizen is not a happy read, but magnificent all the same. The mixture of art, poetics, and realism adds to the profound impact of this work. Many of the prose poems come off like short diary entries, chronicling the daily affronts to dignity faced even by a college professor of color. She reports both the condescension and abuse of systemic racism and the perhaps more appalling liberties from friends who can't see their own behavior as offensive. \"How difficult is it for one body to feel the injustice wheeled at another?\" she asks. \n Rankine goes beyond her own hurts to call out police abuse, the public humiliations of Serena Williams, the lack of government concern for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and more. In \"Stop-and-Frisk,\" she uses poignant repeated phrases to mirror the repetition of the familiar scene: After \"Get on the ground now,\" she writes, \"And you are not the guy and still you fit the description/because there is only one guy who is always the guy fitting/the description.\"","date":"2016-01-11"}
{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"****4 kind in cruel situations STARS**** \n Saben que la poesia no es lo mio, aun asi ultimamente me he sentido mas atraida a darle una oportunidad, especialmente a la contemporanea. \n El libro inicio muy bien, dandonos crueles y crudas verdades sobre todo tipo de abuso. Algunos poemas eran realmente desgarradores, obviamente unos me pegaron mas que otros, ya que la poesia refleja nuestras propias experiencias y como tal unos nos acomodan mas que otros. \n Mi favorito fue este: \n El poema que me hizo llorar fue este, fuck como me identifique con el. \n \"father. you always call to say nothing in particular. you ask what i'm doing or where i am and when the silence stretches like a lifetime between us i scramble to find questions to keep the conversation going. what i long to say most is. i understand this world broke you. it has been so hard on your feet. i don't blame you for not knowing how to remain soft with me. sometimes i stay up thinking of all the places you are hurting which you'll never care to mention. i come from the same aching blood. from the same bone so desperate for attention i collapse in on myself. i am your daughter. i know the small talk is the only way you know how to tell me you love me. cause it is the only way i know how to tell you.\" \n En la segunda parte del libro, se empieza a enfocar mas en el desamor y senti que bajo la intensidad de este. O quiza es porque ese tema no me hace sentir nada, pero si senti que el libro se desinflo. \n Al final retoma un poco el camino y nos da mensajes d esperanza, superacion y solo seguir intentandolo. \n Me gustaron mucho las ilustraciones, son simplistas y encajan a la perfeccion cada uno de los mensajes. \n Leanlo, sin duda es uno de los mejores libros de poesia contemporanea que he leido (no que haya leido muchos).","date":"2017-01-03"}

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":4,"review_text":"I picked up this book because I fell in love with Woodson's story in \n Flying Lessons and Other Stories \n called Main Street. The narrative in Main Street was achingly beautiful, nostalgic, and poignant, and so on a whim, I picked up Brown Girl Dreaming at my library without so much as a glance at what it was about - just in time for Black History Month too. \n Brown Girl Dreaming is a memoir told in verse. Not only is this narrative style unique, it was utterly spectacular. In a series of poems, Woodson interweaves emotion with words thus creating a powerful but down-to-earth story of Woodson's life of growing up between South Carolina and New York. Though some poems moved me more than others, it was an wondrous feeling to be so immersed in Woodson's life. The senses come alive while reading Brown Girl Dreaming - I haven't read poetry so compelling before. \n I didn't just appear one day. \n I didn't just wake up and know how to write my name. \n I keep writing, knowing now \n that I was a long time coming. \n Over the course of the memoir, Woodson's vivid poems draw attention to a variety of themes, specifically family, race, religion, and the Civil Rights movement that crescendos in her youth. Though the contents of this exploration were wonderful - and best discovered and read first-hand - what truly stands out is Woodson's outstanding ability to capture memory and moments in time. There was a dreamlike quality to her writing, without it being fantastical or detached. Above all, however, is that Brown Girl Dreaming is told in such a way that everything felt so raw, bearing the significance of each moment (even if it's told in retrospect) and making each turning point in Woodson's life feel almost tangible. \n Then I let the stories live \n inside my head, again and again \n until the real world fades back \n into cricket lullabies \n and my own dreams. \n However, the thing I really connected to in Brown Girl Dreaming was how Woodson masterfully captured the perspective of a child growing up. A particularly memorable part is when Woodson contemplates the conflict about religion within her family, finding her passion in writing, and also the Civil Rights movement. Though the narrative explores these through the eyes of the child, such explorations were not diminished or simplified in any way. Woodson perfectly demonstrates the wisdom of children, and how the worlds of adults and perceptions of a younger mind can have the power to shape an individual and how they find their place in this world. More so, as readers we come to understand how Woodson understood the movement, how she grows to understand it, and what it would later mean to her. \n Brown Girl Dreaming is a powerful and important contribution to children's books, perfect for everyone of all ages - even adults! - and especially for younger kids. With stunning imagery and emotionally charged poems, Woodson has crafted a stunning book that is brimming with personal history, feeling, and memory. \n Rating: 4/5 \n - \n This review can also be found on my book blog, Read, Think, Ponder!","date":"2017-01-20"}

It felt like an incredibly raw, powerful truth was being delivered sometimes, but other times... it was a little juvenile. \n I guess this is difficult to explain, but the juvenile stuff really gave me the impression of something posted on Wattpad, while the deeper stuff felt more like something people study in professional literature classes.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"Before we get started, just want to put out a quick disclaimer. This review is not coming from a poetry reader. Above what I have to study for uni, I usually avoid it like the plague. Rarely do I find myself interested enough in an anthology to go out, buy it and then read it from cover to cover. With all that in mind, the fact that I made it the whole way through Milk and Honey says a lot about this collection. \n I wasn't entirely sure what this anthology was going to entail when I started out. I knew it had a feminist association, but beyond that, I didn't know anything about the actual content of the poems. This book deals with issues such as rape, abuse, broken heartedness and other aspects of the feminist agenda. At some points, I found the discussion a little awkward, but still, I appreciated the message of the anthology and so can't put up too much of a fight. \n I really enjoyed the presentation of this anthology, especially in terms of simplicity in illustrations and use of white space. Overall, this book was beautifully composed, which made it all the more enjoyable to read. Kaur was able to strike a wonderful balance between barren and busy allowing her to highlight, rather than detract from, the beauty of the text. \n The collection is divided into three main sections, each one dealing with a different aspect of relationships. I flew through each of the sections, but my favourite one had to be the final installment (The Healing). This section was really empowering and I think would be a great read after a breakup - it has a very 'you go girl'-like attitude. \n However (we all knew there was going to be a 'but', it is me after all), I only ended up marking 3 poems throughout the entire anthology. In a collection of this size, I would have expected to tab at least triple that! Although none of the poems were expressly bad, many of them just didn't speak to me deeply enough to warrant dog-earing a corner in my beautiful book. Poetry is a very personal thing, so a lot of this may just be put down to my own personal preference and state of mind, but it definitely didn't pack as much of a punch as I would have liked. \n Nevertheless, there were some really beautiful examples of imagery and symbolism dotted throughout this book. Some of which were really clear and thought-provoking. It was obvious that Kaur has laid herself bare in this collection, and, to a degree, I think this is where the true merit of the anthology lies. Even though I didn't necessarily connect with her words, I can understand why this collection was so incredibly successful. \n Overall, I gave this collection a 4/5 stars (in reality it's a 3.75). It was an interesting, quick and touching read, which really made you feel like you were walking around inside Rupi's head. I would definitely recommend this anthology to any feminist reader, or anyone who simply wants an empowering collection about women. \n (if you enjoyed this review, make sure to check out my blog at missabigail.blog )","date":"2017-02-17"}

What I most like about this work is that it shows that no sexual relationship is separated from politics and culture. We have created a world that often condones the abuse of women. Look at the way that high profile rape cases were handled in the U.S. in 2016. Look at the apologists for Donald Trump as he boasts of his mistreatment of women. \n In the second half of this book, the poet shows how her private relationship was impacted and encouraged by a society that says women are chattel. The strength and hope that Kaur evokes is encouraging. \n Still, Trump was elected. We have a long way to go.","date":"2017-01-01"}
{"book_id":"1420","rating":5,"review_text":"I will start by saying that I am in no way qualified to review this book from any legitimate point of view. With the exception of one. I can review it from what I think of it. But, given the amount of discussion and scholarship, my view will likely have errors and only be relevant to me. So, with that warning aside, I will continue. \n First of all, really harsh on woman. I am not saying that Shakespeare holds those points of view, but even now, it is quite common for men not to trust women. There is this illogical dichotomy. Men want women to accept them, but they don't trust them. So, what good is the acceptance anyway? \n Secondly, I would like to talk about the rotten state of Denmark. I am not sure I can point to anything specific in the text, but I have this idea that The killed king (also Hamlet) was not such a good dude. Prior to the action of the play, Hamlet the King of Denmark kills Fortinbras the King of Norway. We are told it is in battle, but I wonder if there was treachery. The reason I think this is that so many people die it feels like there is something larger going on. \n Finally, I know it is frequently discussed that Hamlet is indecisive, but I want to broaden this. There are many times when actions occur with insufficient information to the character. We the audience are much more in the know. But does that aid us in any way? In some fashion, we are as incapable of making a decision as the characters. We can watch. Only. The incapability of anyone in the play to make a POSITIVE move is visceral for us. We are as trapped as Hamlet, Ophelia, even the ghost of King Hamlet.","date":"2016-03-14"}

What drew me to this was not only the hype that surrounded it, but I've read some of this author's poems online and I was drawn to her words. \n While not too many poems were ones I related to, there were some that I resonated with, some that just pulled me back and made me ponder, and some that pricked at my eyes at the reality of them. \n I could pick my favourites on one hand, but the one that stood out to me was: \n \"You must want to spend your life with yourself first.\" \n This one gave me the perfect chills and spoke to my soul. A few more... \n \"You must enter a relationship with yourself before anyone else.\" \n \"The thing about writing is I can't tell if its's healing or destroying me.\" \n And one more for the road... \n \"If you are not enough for yourself you will never be enough for someone else.\" \n The drawings in here was a welcome treat and really brings the words to life.

Last I checked, most everyone living has been through the end of a relationship. Consequently, everyone living will likely find at least one nugget of value in Kaur's book of poems. \n The text is broken into four parts: The Hurting, The Loving, The Breaking, and The Healing. \n The Hurting alludes to abuse she's endured in her life. \n The Loving, somewhat obviously, goes into relationships based on trust, love, and attraction. \n The Breaking is the loss of the aforementioned Loving. \n Finally, The Healing is the graceful, albeit painful, journey to hope after grieving. \n Personally, I rate the book of poems a 3.5. I found many of them touching, which I appreciated. However, many of the themes came across as trite and somewhat overused (post-The Hurting, for those were raw and unique); the loving and the breaking were the ones which connoted cliche. \n The drawings included in the book as companions to the poems were simple and definitely added a nice touch (note: these were also done by Kaur). To me, the drawings were akin to Shel Silverstein--simple black and white, yet powerful. \n I very much wish I would have had this book when I was getting a divorce, even in the year or two afterwards. \n \"There is a difference,\" she writes, \"between someone telling you they love you and them actually loving you.\" Additionally: \n you are in the habit \n of co-depending \n on people to \n make up for what \n you think you lack \n who tricked you \n into believing \n another person \n was meant to complete you \n when the most they can do is complement \n I could have used those words so much then.

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":4,"review_text":"I repeat what Bill Kerwin reminded me of in his review of this book: At a Trump rally, there is a woman sitting behind him reading a book while he speaks. Citizen: An American Lyric is the book she was reading. Trump is of course unapologetically and infamously racist against various races (and religions, women, and so on), so the woman behind Trump uses the opportunity to read this anti-racist book, knowing it will get national coverage; we see the title, we check it out: Powerful political commentary. Political performance art. \n I have not been reading many books in the past couple years specifically just about race. I read the news and political commentary every day and I live in the current murder capitol of the world, Chicago, one of the cities where young black men have been gunned down on the street by the police. So I without question read about racism and observe it every day. I teach in urban Chicago, am regularly in the Chicago Public Schools. And so on. \n I have twice in the past six months read National Book Award winner Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates, which I found to be powerful and eloquent on the subject of race, and the Goodreads algorithm suggested I check out this \"related\" text, and reminded me that this book, Citizen, is a National Book award finalist from the previous year, nominated for both the National Book Circle Award in poetry AND criticism. When I saw that, I ordered it right away. I am a sucker for multi-genre and multi-media texts, of which this is surely one. \n I didn't love the execution of it quite as much as the conception, but it did like it, and I read it twice in the past three days. I liked it better the second time, the more I paid attention to the movement in it. Coates's book is sort of conventional in comparison, a memoir, a letter to his fifteen year old son about growing up as a black body in the old U. S. of A. Citizen is at once a meditation on that same topic and also announces itself as an \"American lyric\" that some have categorized as poetry, though some of it is prose; at least a third of it are scripts written for various video collaborations with John Lucas, who also provides some of the images for the book, and who designed it. \n As \"lyrical\" it isn't meant to be coherent. It's not primarily an argumentative essay; rather, it's meant to be evocative, enigmatic, at turns enraged, but more often thoughtful. Much if it is cultural commentary, or cultural criticism, such as an essay about Serena Williams that takes up a good part of it. I think of the whole of the book as lyrical essay. The last third is the weakest section, the video pieces; it feels less integrated into the whole than the rest, feels sort of tacked on to me. My mind wandered a bit in that section. \n The whole feels like a kind of mediation on citizenship, make of that meditation what you will, because she is not writing James Baldwin essays or Coates memoir. She is making with Lucas bricolage, or pastiche. Some of it is just small observations of every day racism, the everydayness of \n it that we participate in and may not quite acknowledge. I recommend your checking it out. As I said, I liked the form of it more than the actual writing itself. But the writing itself can still be lovely in places and provocative throughout.","date":"2016-04-05"}
{"book_id":"1371","rating":3,"review_text":"I feel like this book is difficult to rate, because, being a classic, it has its own kind of sphere which it's not up to me or any other reader to decide if it's good or not, because it's already established as a canon and my opinion and many other's really do not matter. The book will always stand on its own whether I write it 1 star or 5 stars. \n That being said, the reason that I rate this as a 3 is mostly because of what it meant to me to read it. It was difficult, hard to get through. It's like reading Game of Thrones-- so much going on at once. And you lose track of it. You lose track of who is who, whose children is who's, who belongs to here, who belongs to there--I only managed to kind of understand it when I wrote it down almost by the end. \n It also affects the fact I read this for college \n *ahemI'mtotallynotusingschoolbookstoprogressonmyreadingchallengeahem* \n because I did not have the time to actually sit through it and study it and understand it completely, and give time for everything to soak in.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"Some of the poems were able to speak to me, but most of them made me feel nothing, and that's an important aspect for poetry to succeed at for me. Lots of them had no deeper meaning to decipher - they were exactly what they stated, so simply that it wasn't even beautiful. I feel like that's the trade off - if you're going to be literal with your poetry, the crafting must be beautiful. I felt as though this collection was very unsuccessful in that way. Very specifically, there were two poems in this collection that said the *exact* same thing, but the metaphor was different - interchangeable poems aren't... a good thing. That said, a big part of this collection is perspective, and I don't think I'm the target demographic, for various reasons. All in all, I don't think the crafting missteps make up for being outside the ideal reader demographic. While not every single life experience described in the collection was personally relatable for me, I do have working empathetic faculties, so those poems should have been able to stir emotion in me beyond \"this isn't very good\".

The subject matter is beyond what your inner voice can comprehend.

I went to see a theatrical interpretation of the epic in February, so I thought that was the perfect reason to motivate myself to read this. \n It was difficult for me to read, mostly because I hated all of the characters and it was hard to get past all of the casual mentions of habitually raping \"prize\" women. Maybe I'll do a little better with The Odyssey, because I've read and liked selections from it. \n Also: the Trojan horse thing is not in the Iliad! I found that surprising.

So, perhaps hearing this work performed would make a difference because reading it, I couldn't get past the cliche descriptions and contradictions -- destroy vs healing, weakness vs. strength, full vs. empty. I wanted this poet to go deeper and push the potential power of the beginning, but instead it was lost quickly. Honestly, it read like a teenaged girl's diary in which she tried to write something so meaningful but fell woefully short so she added sketches to help get the meaning across.

{"book_id":"1420","rating":4,"review_text":"Before reading this book, I really thought that this would be full of medieval English royalty mumble jumble. After reading it through though, I have realised why this book is so well known and admired. This is a story that involves the revenge of the death of the hero's father. A lot of plots and schemes take place, as the hero plans carefully his revenge. In the hero's attempt to unveil his uncle's treachery, people believe he is mad as he adopts a strange behavior. His uncle, who allegidly killed Hamlet's father, tries with the help of the hero's closest friends to discover what is inside Hamlet's mind, because he suspects Hamlet has found out about his plan whose puspose was to usurp his father's throne. Of course all the above could not lead to any good, and that is why the ending is tragic and involves a lot of death. This book puts the reader under many ethical/life dilemmas which some of them happen to be famous lines of the author, such as \"To be or not to be...\", lines which most of us have heard from time to time. This play is worth its fame and will keep you interested with its narration, because many events happen leading to the story's end. Conclusively, I have heard that Hamlet is considered one of Sheakspeare's best plays and I think rightfully so.","date":"2016-06-08"}

The language is meditative as if reading a translated Hafiz work. Kaur takes one on a physical and psychological journey of love as a process that is sometimes brutal, encompassing every part of one's being. She touches the raw nerve, the pulse of the experience of love for another as well as for oneself. With this said, the structure of her work is definitely a direct translation of the spoken word pieces. This work needs, almost begs to be read out loud (preferably with a box of tissues and a strong drink). She does not ground her self in traditional poetic devices or structure that may have helped the poems read more smoothly (the awkward placement of punctuation and fragment sentences in her prose were distracting at times.) \n The first three chapters were strong and much more engaging than the last chapter.

My problem is not the subject, even if I could not relate very much to it - though people who can relate will find this much more comforting and impacting than I did. \n I felt that this was more of a diary of Kaur's, written in her own grammar-disregarding, tumblr-y style. I am no literary genius, but I should think that poetry has some other purpose than to blandly state your thoughts. Poetry, in my mind, would ideally be full of metaphors and imagery and beautiful words and double meanings. There is that, to some extent, but not to the point of something spectacular. For the most part, Kaur said her thoughts exactly as they were; fragmented and all over the place. \n \"there is a difference between/ someone telling you/ they love you and/ them actually/ loving you\" \n \"you were so distant/ i forgot you were there at all\" \n I didn't mind the writing style per se, but some of these topics could have been branched out into essays or longer, more thought-out poems. These are quick, mind-dumps of poetry, in my opinion, with very little content and extra thought. \n removing all the hair/ off your body is okay/ if that's what you want to do/ just as much as keeping all the hair/ on your body is okay/ if that's what you want to do \n Okay, so not the content I expected from such a hyped book. Kaur switches from her own story to little bits of preachy things, but it needed to be fleshed out more. This collection of poetry? thoughts? diary-entries? seemed to me like the bare bones of a work that could be so much more. I understand that this is Kaur's style of writing, but more effort I thought could have been applied, especially in the editorial process. \n Is it just me? Have I become a cold-hearted critic? Are my expectations too high? I've been giving quite a few two stars lately. But I try to remain as honest as possible in my reviews, including Milk and Honey, which I read in one sitting. \n Wait, should I change the title to milk and honey?

A collection of poems from earlier collections with new batch added at the end, this book has poems of various moods, some of which may appear in the same poem, changing the feeling at some point(s). \n There's many with everyday-life feel in them, yet some go beyond and turn things around deliciously. They're often funny too; I didn't find anything too-heavy within. \n The author doesn't write his poems too heavily-laden, which has stopped me reading some poets, nor is the language too tied up to read in the evening when mind isn't at its sharpest focus anymore. \n \"Vade Mecum\" \n I want the scissors to be very sharp \n and the table to be perfectly level \n when you cut me out of my life \n and paste me in that book you always carry. \n I haven't read his stuff before, but I have a feeling I've read \"The Dead\" somewhere before, some anthology I guess. These poems have often lots of nature bits going on, themes whirling around the author's home, and the family dog entering the poems now and then.

My daughter had no issue, she immediately found it extremely fun and funny, way before I got the groove of this book. After a while we were both invested, but I was the one that ended crying. \n Josh and Jordan are 13 year old twins, they are also star basketball players. Josh is our adorable narrator. The poetry includes many different flavors: basketball rules, word definition, and Play-by-Play are some of them. The basketball rules are actually life rules in disguise: \n If you miss \n enough of life's \n free throws \n you will pay \n in the end \n The word definition style, starts with a real definition and becomes very personal (that style also reminded me a lot of Inside Out & Back Again). For example: \n ca*lam*i*ty \n [KUH-LAM-IH-TEE] noun \n An unexpected, \n undesirable event; \n often physically injurious. \n As in: If JB hadn't been acting \n so silly and \n playing around, \n he would have cut \n one lock \n instead of five \n from my head \n and avoided \n this calamity. \n As in: The HUGE bald patch \n on the side \n of my head \n is a dreadful \n calamity. \n As in: After the game \n Mom almost has a fit \n When she sees my hair, \n What a calamity, she says, \n shaking her head \n and telling Dad to take me \n to the barber shop \n on Saturday \n to have the rest \n cut off. \n Josh and Jordan are close, but very naturally are also in great competition. Not only both of them being the stars at basketball team (and their father being the ex-champion \"Da Man\"), but also it is the stage for girls. Miss Sweet Tea gets into their lives, and many emotions emerge in both of them, not only towards her, but mostly towards one another. \n I would say it is not really a story about basketball, even though there is a lot of basketball in it. It is more about family, love and friendship, girlfriends and envy, being nasty to one another, missing loved ones and worrying about them. And once again, I warn you, that you might end up crying. 5 stars.","date":"2016-05-07"}
{"book_id":"20613761","rating":2,"review_text":"I am sad to give this book such a low score. It deals with an important topic, and it can make you furious (for a good reason). But it is so uneven, some sentences are extraordinary, and others way too obscure. \n The topic of race is hard. We all want to believe that we are over it. But in reality we are not. Authors like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie are masterfully uncovering topics of race, not only racism, but belonging, and culture gaps, and so much more. Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell mentions the IAT test to show that all of us are biased, even the blacks among us (go to www.implicit.harvard.edu). \n Claudia Rankine's refers to this: \n Who said that? She said what? What did he just do? Did she really just say that? He said what? What did she do? Did I hear what I think I heard? Did that just come out of my mouth, his mouth, your mouth? Do you remember when you sighed? \n I strongly recommend reading Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking and to look for the part that deals with mind reading, and how seven seconds can be life and death. \"I seen his right hand,\" Boss said later. \"It was out from his body. His palm was open. And where there should have been a gun, there was a wallet....I said, 'Where's the fucking gun?... \n He's out there alone. At twelve-thirty in the morning. In this lousy neighborhood. Alone. A black guy. He's got a gun; otherwise he wouldn't be there. And he's little, to boot. Where's he getting the balls to stand out there in the middle of the night? He's got a gun. '\" \n And in Claudia Rankine's words: \n And still you are not the guy and still you fit the description because there is only one guy who is always the guy fitting the description. \n About 2.5 stars, because I find that it misses the strong points.","date":"2016-03-18"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"You're going to see a lot of poor reviews for this book of poetry. Let me start by giving you key phrases to weed through them: \"This book is too Tumblr\", \"the poetry is too simple\", \"the poetry is too complex\", \"I don't like how feminist this is\", \"how is this feminist?\". \n I'll refute them all in a single sentence: poetry doesn't have to be complex or simple to be meaningful, and a woman discussing her experiences aren't things to be dismissed- they are inherently feminist when they comment on the greater issues of a whole. \n Kaur's words are beautiful- even when they are simple phrases (\"you pinned/my legs to/ the ground/with your feet/and demanded/i stand up\") or more complex sentiments (\"there is no bigger illusion in the world/then the idea that a woman will/bring dishonor into a home/if she tries to keep her heart/and her body safe\"), they strike home and, sometimes? They hurt. I think the first time I found myself pausing with the poems is when she discusses how fathers (in our shared experience, brown fathers specifically) will yell at their daughters but then tell them it's because they love them so much- and how that leads to us excusing abuse in our later romantic situations (\"you yell at her/out of love/you teach her to confuse/anger with kindness/which seems like a good idea/till she grows up to/trust men who hurt her\"). Like that's... a little too relatable, Kaur. Got me right where it hurts. \n Even if you don't consider yourself a feminist, even if you're not brown, or mixed brown, or any variation of color, I think this is very much so a book of poems that you need to read at least once. \n Favorite lines: \n * \"you have sadness / living in places / sadness shouldn't live\" \n * \"taking hits at the most vulnerable parts of one another. we're like fingers on thorns honey. we know exactly where it hurts.\" \n * \"the woman who comes after me will be a bootleg version of who i am. she will try and write poems for you to erase the ones i've left memorized on your lips but her lines could never punch you in the stomach the way mine did\" \n * \"you are in the habit / of co-depending / on people to / make up for what / you think you lack / who tricked you / into believing / another person / was meant to complete you / when the most they can do is / complement\"","date":"2016-11-02"}

I love the way she claims her body, encouraging other women, in particular, to do the same. I'm not sure if her writings are limited to cis women; I certainly hope not, and I think they are relevant to all women-identifying people. I definitely want to be corrected, though, if that is not the case. \n Beautifully disjointed as only reality can be, Kaur does not step back from the hard but instead showcases it in all its ugly glory. She is in many ways the inner voice of most women, I would argue, who have experienced pain in this patriarchal world without knowing how to acknowledge that pain. \n I need my own copy.

Another impulse purchase at @shakespeareandcoparis turned out to be an inspirational bible nonetheless. These letters to Franz Xaver Kappus from Rainer Maria Rilke read like a collection of delicate and flowery prose to a lover, the lover being the art and endeavor of writing. The painstaking thought put into his florid and oft times lengthy responses to the young poet help those of us readers today recognize the invaluable results of time and living in the present. \"What matters is to live everything.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"Completed Book 39: September 6. As sweet as \"milk and honey\" can be (it has its moments), it also can be quite bitter and rough to swallow. Rupi Kaur is quite a young poet, and a lively writer. Her verse is relatable at times, jarring during other instances, and soothing during its mellower moments. She deals in some dark territory, so reader beware of sexual and violent overtures more than undertones. Akin to many new contemporary poets moving away from traditional structure and form, so does Rupi. This freshman effort is almost nostalgic for me; I can see myself picking it up in a few years and thinking, \"Remember the days way back when? Everything seems so raw and earnest when you're a young adult trying to find yourself and your purpose.\" And maybe some day I will. Find myself that is.","date":"2016-09-05"}

She doesn't shy away from baring all raw emotion as she feels it, as it's happening. I can see her setting pen to paper to quickly let it all out. Not to mention she's illustrated her book with the quirkiest of self portraits. Love's misadventures may not always be fun, but Leav's way with words is.","date":"2016-07-14"}

Se sociable, pero no con todos. Al amigo que te pruebe su amistad sujetalo al alma con aros de acero, pero no embotes tu mano agasajado al primer conocido que te llegue. Guardate de rinas, pero, si peleas, haz que tu adversario se guarde de ti. A todos presta oidos; tu voz, a pocos. Escucha el juicio de todos, y guardate el tuyo. Viste cuan fino permita tu bolsa, mas no estrafalario; elegante, no chillon, pues el traje suele revelar al hombre, y los franceses de rango y calidad son de suma distincion a este respecto. Ni tomes ni des prestado, pues dando se suele perder prestamo y amigo, y tomando se vicia la buena economia.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"I'll be the first to admit I don't know much about poetry. I know rhyming schemes, I have a vague sense for the rules surrounding most forms of poem. Mostly I just know that I like it when a phrase hits me in the gut, and I'm most likely to find those phrases in poetry. \n This book has struck a lot of people, a lot of teens, as I sell at least one per week lately. Usually it's more, usually we sell out by Wednesday when we get our new shipments in on Tuesday. I think this is fantastic. So I picked up a copy for myself, to see what had so many kids flocking over from the high school to get this book. \n I would have loved this book as a teenager. As an adult it's still pretty good in most places. The romance chapter is a little 'meh' but I am not a romantic person in the slightest. Still, though. \n you were temptingly beautiful \n but stung when i got close \n That felt like a flat note in what was otherwise a pretty enchanting chapter. \n The chapter on rape could have been stronger, I think, if some of the repetitive segments had been removed: \n she was a rose \n in the hands of those \n who had no intention \n of keeping her \n That one felt a little deflated toward the end. It said what it was supposed to say, but it did it without the power some of the other poems have. Like: \n he guts her \n with his fingers \n like he's scraping \n the inside of a \n cantaloupe clean \n Just. Holy shit, I have such a visceral reaction to those five lines. That's the punch I was looking for. \n What I loved about this collection, though, is the message that you must love yourself, that you must be strong for yourself, before you can be loving or strong with anyone else. I loved the way this book was laid out: from pain, to hope, to heartbreak, to saving herself. \n I see why people keep buying out my stock, and I'm really glad that they are.

I just lost patience maybe. \n There are exceptions of course. Like others, I did find this one touching: \n The art of losing isn't hard to master; \n so many things seem filled with the intent \n to be lost that their loss is no disaster, \n Lose something every day. Accept the fluster \n of lost door keys, the hour badly spent. \n The art of losing isn't hard to master. \n Then practice losing farther, losing faster: \n places, and names, and where it was you meant \n to travel. None of these will bring disaster. \n I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, or \n next-to-last, of three loved houses went. \n The art of losing isn't hard to master. \n I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster, \n some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent. \n I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster. \n - Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture \n I love) I shan't have lied.

{"book_id":"82356","rating":4,"review_text":"Lo seguire afirmando: me gustan mas las tragedias de Shakespeare. Sin embargo, tengo que admitir que disfrute muchisimo esta comedia por varias razones. \n Principalmente, hay un encanto en la doble perspectiva. Tenemos cuatro personas, dos pares que actuan como reflejo el uno del otro; ese juego de acciones confunde inclusive al espectador hasta hacerle dudar de la identidad de los personajes, pero tambien de las apariencias. Es una manera muy sutil de afirmar cual lejos estamos de conocernos a nosotros mismos, especialmente cuando el mundo nos presenta una circunstancia insolita; la vida es tan variable y tan confusa que puede arrasar con todo: perspectivas, suenos, creencias. \n Sin personajes estelares y un desenlace fluido, creo que ha sido una de las comedias que mas he disfrutado leer. Mas que reirse de lo absurdo, con esta obra Shakespeare se rie del publico ingenuo. Todos luchamos con esa contraparte desconocida y ajena que aparece inesperadamente; todos estamos divididos pero dispuestos a encontrar las respuestas mas acertadas en una marea de equivocaciones ridiculas.","date":"2016-01-28"}

{"book_id":"23534","rating":5,"review_text":"Reading Bukowski was like watching the self disintegration of fragile, ephemeral things. \n He was a man in an acceleration process of self-destruct, which ironically was the only way he could come to 'a more amicable term' with his colourfully austere life. A son of German immigrant parents, much of his childhood was painted with regular beatings from his father, often with a razor strop. And later in his life he would have troubles with the FBI and would spend some time in jail because of draft evasion suspicion following the eruption of World War II. By the time he wrote Love is a Dog from Hell he was screwing with everyone and drank like there was no tomorrow. (of course I didn't know the man personally, but from his writing--and wikipedia, and the internet, and some shady articles on the internet--I somewhat can picture his lifestyle.) \n Love to him is a dog from hell. Stanza after stanza he explored every grave possibility of love, although sometimes he talked about something that seems to me sweet or severely romantic. \n With vulgar phrases, raunchy insinuations, and violent swearing, this book is at risk of being dismissed as superficial and shallow, and his whole body of work too, being righteously outlaw and ghetto-championing, he was often seen as an anarchist, but no, really, he was not. He was just being real. I think that is the whole point: he was being brutally honest about his life and his life ain't pretty. Offering a peek into the 1970s American lowlife he can be funny and he can be sad. He can be ironic and he can be sarcastic. He can be anything because he talked about everything--the girl he screwed, the girl he couldn't screw, cockroaches in his house, coke and coleslaw, alcohol, and some more alcohol. I wrote 'he talked' not 'he wrote' because simply his writing sounds more like he was talking. If you hated highbrow poems with rigid structure and forced rhyming you'd appreciate Bukowski. Here's an excerpt from his poem 'fuck' \n She pulled her dress off/ over her head/ and I saw the panties/ intended somewhat into the/ crotch. \n He was nice that way.","date":"2016-03-03"}

It says so much without saying it that by the end of the book, you feel as though you want to hug Rupi Kaur for all she writes about but also feel that if she hugged you back, it would be because you experienced similar situations which is why her words jumped off the page and danced before you a private ballet. \n When my sisters both read her book, I actually rolled my eyes because why would they fall head over heals for a book unless it was popular. Then, I retracted that eye roll when I started reading it and Kaur's words grabbed me by the shirt collar like a thug on the street looking to rob me but then mistakenly realized I was a long lost cousin and smoothed down my shirt and said, Coffee? \n For full review, please visit thesmartcookiephiles.wordpress.com","date":"2016-12-17"}

I don't read much of it, so maybe that's why, but there's also the fact that so much of poetry revolves around emotions and personal experiences and just pouring your heart and soul into things. Putting a star rating on it is just kind of hard to me! \n I read this all in one sitting. It was very good, lots of emotions put into it. Most of it I couldn't really relate to, though, which is probably why I am not rating it is as high as some others have. (This has a 4.39 star rating here on Goodreads, so clearly it is very good.) Maybe I am too young to relate to some of the things? \n Here were some poems/passages I especially liked: \n \"When I am sad, I don't cry, I pour. When I am happy, I don't smile, I glow. When I am angry, I don't yell, I burn. ... When my heart is broken, I don't grieve, I shatter.\" \n I liked this one not necessarily because I could relate to it (I am bad at showing my emotions, to be honest) but because it reminded me a lot of some of the characters in my own book that I'm writing, and so it made me kind of emotional because of that. \n \"Some people are so bitter. To them you must be kindest.\" \n This seemed like such a Hufflepuff sort of quote to me, and as a Hufflepuff, I liked it a lot. \n \"I am water. Soft enough to offer life. Tough enough to drown it away.\" \n I think I've heard something kind of similar to this before, but I still liked this sentiment and also the illustration on this page was so nice. I liked the drawing a lot. \n \"Do not look for healing at the feet of those who broke you.\" \n A good reminder for everyone out there, and something I need to remember more often. \n \"To be soft is to be powerful.\" \n Again, this is such a Hufflepuff quote which makes it something I can relate to a lot. It might've been my favorite little quote from this book, it was just so nice to read and to think that 'Just because I am not loud, and rebellious, does not mean I am weak!'. \n \"The thing about writing is I can't tell if it's healing or destroying me.\" \n This one was probably my favorite, just because it's something that has been going around in my head and heart for a long time, but it's something I guess I've never quite had the words for. I could go on a whole ramble about how accurate this quote is for me and why it is my favorite, but I won't bore you with the details. \n Overall, this book had a very \"aesthetic\" vibe around it, and though I couldn't relate to most of the quotes and poems there were many gems that I liked a lot.","date":"2016-12-27"}

{"book_id":"30118","rating":5,"review_text":"What can I say about Shel Silverstein that hasn't already been said before? I love his books and his poetry. I've been reading Mr. Silverstein's poems since I was 10 years old and I'm now 28. I never get tired of his books. \n I love to read these poems especially on days when I feel sad or angry, because these poems always cheer me up and make me laugh. \n Oh man, I can't help but laugh every single time I read, 'The Sitter'. That poem's all kinds of crazy but in a hilarious way. To read about a baby-sitter actually sitting on a baby is horrifying, but for me what makes the poem funny, is that it seems to be told from an older sibling of the baby's POV. \n 'How Not To Have To Dry The Dishes' makes me remember being a pre-teen and a teenager and feeling the same way as the little girl in the poem. I won't deny that I used to look for any and every excuse to get out of doing the dishes, and this poem just brings a smile to my face. \n From 'Shaking,' to 'Put Something In,' to 'Snake Problem,' to 'Bear In There', to 'Hurk' and more. These poems make laugh and I love reading them to and with my niece and oldest nephew, where we laugh like crazy every single time we read this book. \n Mr. Silverstein's gift for writing amazing and funny poetry will always be around in years to come, and I just love that. I can't get enough of his books and I wish he had written lots more before passing away. \n I'll have to check out his other books and see if I like them. And since Mr. Silverstein's a pretty wonderful poet and author, I'm more than sure that I'll like and/or love his other books.","date":"2016-05-24"}
{"book_id":"30119","rating":5,"review_text":"Shel Silverstein's one of my favorite poets/authors. I've been reading his poems for years and even as an adult, I still love reading his books. His books and his poetry are some of the best written out there. \n From 'The Acrobats' to 'Magic' to 'Homemade Boat', to 'It's Dark In Here' to ' The Loser' to 'Listen \n To The Mustn'ts' to 'Smart' to 'For Sale' and a whole lot more. \n This book never fails to make me laugh until I'm in tears, it's that good. I think my favorite poems in this book are 'It's Dark In Here', 'Smart,' and 'For Sale'. I love all the poems in this book, but those are my favorites. \n I can't help but burst out laughing every single time I read 'For Sale.' It's just too cute and funny to not laugh. Also, 'Dark In Here', how can you not laugh at the pure silliness of this poem? It cracks me up. \n I wish that I had Shel Silverstein's talent for writing funny poems. I've tried it a few times, but it always feels forced. Mr. Silverstein had an amazing talent for making me and millions of other people laugh. \n I look forward to getting more of his books, because I enjoy his poems that much. If any teachers or parents ever end up reading my review here, I'm telling you, you should buy some of Mr. Silverstein's books for your children or students. \n These books are just that great and you and your students or you and your children can enjoy these poems for years and years to come.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"enh, you guys, i don't know. i don't really like rating poetry, because i feel like... it's so personal and subjective, more so than other forms of writing are. what might wow you and make you cry might not do much for me. and this little collection really did not do much for me. \n i know a lot of people recoil instantly when they see weird punctuation & line breaks, but i'm not one of them. i've loved many a weirdly formatted poem in my time. that said, weird punctuation & line breaks do not a poem make, and a lot of the poems in this book, for me, had little else to them. way too prosaic to be poems, they just came off as regular vaguely meaningful sentences broken up oddly for aesthetic purposes, which didn't work for me at all. at the same time, there wasn't enough narrative heft in there for me to really consider it prose either, so i was just kind of left unsatisfied in the middle. \n i liked the topics she was addressing, but one or two pieces aside, i didn't find much poetry or lyricism in there. there's a poem which is written as a sort of response to one of warsan shire's poems, and reading that made me go like.. oh yeah, i can see it. it does kind of feel like warsan shire, just... not as good. -\\_(tsu)_/- wasn't for me, but it's a short book and it's worth checking out if you're curious! \n (this is why i don't like reviewing poetry, i come of as such a dick when i don't like it.)","date":"2017-01-19"}

Moreover, given the topics that it should have dealt with according to the synopsis, I feel like it is more focused on one topic, the sexual aspect and such ashamed that it out-shadowed the other important matters that has been point out in the synopsis.

{"book_id":"18003300","rating":1,"review_text":"Tumblr fodder. That's all I can say. I hate being negative about things other people wrote. It never brings me satisfaction. But poetry is the dearest thing in the world to me. And while it is subjective and personal, when it enters into the public arena, it becomes subject to criticism. And I have a lot of criticism for this collection of rhyming, saccharine verse. I've never seen anything so undisciplined before (except maybe Franco's book). This is something I'd expect out of a fourteen-year-old in English class. Case in point: \n HIS CAUSE & EFFECT \n He make me turn, \n he makes me toss; \n his words mean mine \n are at a loss. \n He make me blush! \n he makes me want \n to brush and floss. \n The exclamation points, the rhyme scheme...and not just the rhyme scheme, the subject of each poem is the same person! This seems utterly unhealthy; nothing that should be immortalized and bound for thousands of young girls to read. It just reads like a horny school girls' diary. Where's the depth? The craft? The soul? I don't mind carnal poetry, but come on lady. You're an adult! Is there anything else in your life except some dude pinching your nipples and asking you if it hurts? There's much more to love than what you give us, more to life. And your limericks are paltry in comparison to all of that. \n I don't understand the raves. I really don't. I hate to sound like a snob, but if being a snob means I'm one of the few who recognizes how disappointingly shallow this is in subject matter and literary value, so be it. I'll be a snob. Life is too short to waste my time trying to glean some sort of value from this when there is so much more nuanced, beautiful, complex poetry out there. Much more sexy too, if that's what you're after. If you want sex metaphors, there's plenty out there...better than this sophomoric attempt.","date":"2016-10-14"}
{"book_id":"18263725","rating":5,"review_text":"Stretch before you read The Crossover by Kwame Alexander. And also, take out a box of tissues and some chocolate, you know, for after...when you're ugly crying at work (which is where I was when I was reading this.) \n I'm not the biggest fan of books written in verse. And I don't particularly enjoy basketball or any competitive sport, really. But, as soon as my eyes landed on the first page, I started reading and didn't stop until I was finished. \n The narrator of the story is Josh \"Filthy McNasty\" Bell, a middle-school basketball prodigy. He and his twin brother, Jordan (or JB) play on the basketball team. Family and basketball are the two constants in Josh's life. He loves them more than anything. His dad, also a basketball player in his prime, uses basketball as an allegory for life, delivering life lessons at every opportunity such as \"Rebounding/ is the art/ of anticipating,/ of always being prepared/ to grab it./ But you can't/ drop the ball\" (p 146). \n I love the Kwame Alexander's use of style and font to deliver the story. The book burst with new energy on every page. This is a story about growing up, about love and family. It's about how the people you love the most can hurt you the most. But they are also the only ones who truly know you. Kwame Alexander examines this dichotomy with skill. He shows how fraternal love can turn into competition and, later, isolation. How paternal love can quickly become disillusionment. How sorrow and anger can be turned into power and strength. And how life can quickly become something new and frightening. Alexander deftly displays the loneliness of a young boy in the midst of change and turmoil without being condescending to the seemingly small by comparison issues of his life. And though I know nothing about basketball, still have no idea what a crossover is, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The basketball jargon doesn't really faze when you realize that you, the reader, are in the sidelines watching this boy navigate the court of life. And that's the important part.","date":"2016-01-03"}

{"book_id":"2547","rating":2,"review_text":"This is one of the highly rated and beloved book our time. My rating for this is not the reflection of the quality of this book, but it is of my intellect. Simply speaking, I, an average reader and person, was not ready for this book. \n I read in its description that it contains fables, I thought it was like Aesop's fables. It's not, I should have paid more attention to the description. It's a collection of twenty six prose poetry fables which are philosophical and spiritual. It's the thinnest of the thin books, with very few words, but the meaning and depth it covers about life and everything else is infinite. \n I felt that this book is not for an average reader or person. One needs to close one's eyes and reflect upon every word after reading every single line. Even that would not be sufficient. To correctly understand and interpret meaning and philosophies of this book an average person needs a teacher and guidance. This book could be used by a philosophy professor to teach a class for a whole semester or could be used by a reverend to deliver sermons. \n I don't know if there exists an annotated and explained version of this book, but that's the least one should pick for reading. I was able to understand a few chapters, but most of the chapters went over my head as I didn't invest any time in reflecting upon the teachings in this book.

Milk and Honey e dividido em tres partes: dor, amor, separacao e recuperacao. Todas as partes me tocaram profundamente e eu me identifiquei com diversos textos.

I think almost anyone could relate to, at least, some part of this book (I know I definitely did) and find comfort in that. \n Overall, I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone, but especially to those who are new to poetry and would like to ease themselves into it; or anyone who has recently gone through a breakup.","date":"2016-09-01"}

Not every poem resonated with me, but most did provide a point of view that I could understand and empathize with. \n The poems are surprisingly evocative despite their length.

I am not familiar with Woodson's other work, as I am not a YA fan (and never was, even at the target age), but, although targeted at the same age group, this is autobiography, and so goes down easier with me than YA fiction. I particularly enjoyed the insight into what it was like to be black and living in the south during the Civil Rights Movement, and would have liked more of that. That was not, however, Woodson's main focus--she wove that into a bigger picture of what it was like to be a child moved from one home to another--Ohio to Greensboro, NC to New York City. This is a very fast read, and it does create a vivid portrait of family and social life in the early 60s.

All the art in this volume is amazing and engages with the message in ways that expand it. \n I'm absolutely on board with the message too. There is great value in speaking and cataloging the myriad of micro-aggressions and examples of blind privilege experienced by African Americans as they go through their daily lives. Rankine also explores violence and death, the constant peril that black citizens experience in this country. Presenting the argument in the form of a catalogue can be a powerful device; as I read, I hoped that the aggregation of incidents might be greater than the sum of its parts, but Citizen, never quite achieved that for me. \n This an important book that speaks to race and American culture in this moment, and while the topic moves me, the content too often did not.","date":"2016-10-21"}

{"book_id":"2547","rating":5,"review_text":"See more of my book reviews on my blog, Literary Flits \n Translated into forty languages and never out of print since its 1923 publication, The Prophet is one of those books that I 'should' have read years ago. I'm not sure if I would have appreciated it so much in my twenties though as I do in my forties. Gibran's name has cropped up relatively frequently in other novels I have read over the past couple of years so I thought it was time to give his writing a try. To be honest, I expected to be underwhelmed, reading as if this was a school-chosen book. I did not expect his words and ideas to be so easily accessible, to feel how relevant this book is to my own life, or to enjoy the gorgeous prose and imagery so much. \n The Prophet is essentially a religious book so, as an atheist, I made assumptions before the first page. In reality, while Gibran assumes the existence of God, he does not hammer home any particular faith as 'the true way', but rather addresses various aspects of life - love, work, marriage, food - and has his Prophet offer ideas regarding simple and humane ways of living in harmony with our communities. The simple question and answer structure is concise and effective. I am happy that I will now have a much greater level of understanding when I see Gibran's name dropped elsewhere and I found much food for thought in his philosophy. I can quite see why The Prophet has such widespread appeal. It's a beautiful book.","date":"2017-09-29"}
{"book_id":"27822","rating":4,"review_text":"I haven't read any other translations of Alexander Pushkin's famous poem Yevgeny Onegin so cannot comment on how Anthony Briggs' work differs, but I was surprised at how readable he has rendered the poem. I admit I had been putting off, expecting something quite impenetrable so was pleased to find myself actually enjoying the story and the humour. I particularly loved the descriptive passages which vividly paint snowy Russian villages, exciting sleigh rides and a wonderful ball. The storyline itself is not complicated and relies heavily on well-rounded and believable characters to carry its more melodramatic moments. I happily despised the initially heartless Yevgeny and sympathised with poor unloved Tatyana. The scholarly technicalities of the poem's structure were mostly lost on me. I understand the theory, but found I preferred to be swept along with the beautiful rhythms of the piece than to frequently pause and analyse why those rhythms and rhymes are so effective. \n I think, based on this reading of Yevgeny Onegin, that I would like to tackle more of Pushkin's writing, especially if it has been translated by Anthony Briggs. I liked his style and the interesting essay with which he begins the book that describes the challenges of the translation and the relationships between the languages involved. I didn't realise French was the primary upper class language in Russia in Pushkin's time - much like it was in England in the Middle Ages - but this does explain to me the fluency in French of characters in my other recent Russian read, The Gambler by Dostoyevsky. \n See more of my book reviews on my blogs Literary Flits and Stephanie Jane","date":"2016-07-05"}

This young adult novel in verse tells the story of Jacqueline Woodson's childhood in snatches of memory - from her early days in Columbus Ohio, to her time in Greenville, South Carolina, to her home in Brooklyn, NY. \n Woodson's writing is gorgeous, lush, evocative, and full of that longing for childhood innocence and simplicity. I sped through the novel, wanting to simultaneously devour and savour every word and 'poem' and both learn more about characters (her family and friends) and sit and ruminate on what her experiences and stories mean. \n This novel absolutely deserves all the awards and then some in my opinion. \n She made me think, feel, smile and cry, and re-captured part of childhood for me.","date":"2017-07-31"}

It has, heretofore, been an abstraction to me, this thing that permeates the everyday life of people of color and doesn't touch me at all. I had categorized white privilege in headlines like Not Getting Killed By Cops or Not Having To Worry That My Brother Will Be Shot For Wearing A Hoodie. I had never considered the daily, insidious ways that racism plays out: the comments, insinuations, the sheer invisibility. The realness of my privilege disoriented me. \n Rankine invites us to join her experience by sharing it nakedly, without analysis, judgement, or blame. She writes in micro-fiction snippets, like you just dropped into her story for a minute or fifteen. There you are, in the drug store with her, in a diner, at her therapist's house. Speaking about her experiences of racial micro-aggressions is very, very brave in part because they are often proffered by well-meaning individuals and are thus subject to minimization. But she takes that risk, entrusts her vulnerability to our gaze. \n I found this way of writing richly accessible and deeply inspiring. I wondered what micro-aggressions I have graced and glossed over, normalized, buried in my bones. I wondered what it would feel like to put them on the page. Not the deconstruction of abusive behavior, not the labeling of each traumatic event - just the experience, raw and vulnerable. The words, the sensation in the chest. \n This is poetry. Or micro-fiction. Or memoir. Or Rankine has started a new genre that is now my favorite genre. She packs a lot of gravity into 169 half-pages. Buy it, check it out at the library.

I can see where maybe others would, but it wasn't for me. \n Let's start by saying that it's marketed as a collection of poetry and prose. Fair enough, I suppose it fits those well enough. But if you're someone who enjoys poetry as a fine art...well, you might find yourself wondering what you're reading once you dive in. One of the things I personally love about poetry is it's vast and variable interpretations - so this isn't a knock on this work as poetry, but rather a warning of it's variability and sometimes seeming disorganization. \n If you want my honest opinion, it felt like I was reading angsty teen Tumblr posts for 200 pages. Again, I loved Tumblr years ago but feel that I've aged out of it a bit - so maybe that's my problem here with Milk and Honey too, that I'm simply not in the target demographic. Again, this is totally fine! This book's contents are heartfelt, relatable, and seem to be genuine. There are multitudes of people who love and pour over every word of this collection. Simply though, it wasn't for me. \n What did I think?: This wasn't one that I personally loved but I can see why so many people consider it to be one of the most beautiful things they've ever read. Just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean that it can't be your favorite collection ever. \n Who should read it?: Anyone who's interested in knowing what all of the hype is about, anyone who enjoys heartfelt stories that are painful and genuine, and anyone who wants to experience a different look at prose.

I'm 16 years old, for one. I haven't had unhealthy relationships, and I don't have neglectful, abusive parents. So, because of that, the first two chapters just weren't my cup of tea. The last two chapters were slightly better, but I just felt very disconnected from the story. I had expected to love it, and I didn't. \n I didn't rate this book for a couple reasons.

In fact, I am one of the few that didn't love this book is Goodreads ratings are to be trusted. \n I'm glad I read it just so I won't always look at it and think \"Am I missing out?\" And I ain't mad about reading this because it didn't take long at all, and I would just read for like 15 minutes before bed each night and it was actually kind of nice.","date":"2016-06-27"}

I picked up this book at a time when I really needed some good poetry to dive into. This, coupled with the fact that I have enjoyed reading some of the excerpts on social media, my expectations were high. I heard so many good things about the book too. (Don't get too excited yet, finish reading my review!) \n I must admit - the pain, trauma and recovery she went through were penned with truth and an edge of rawness I enjoyed. Unfortunately, her writing was not up to the standards I was hoping for from a poetry book. There were holes, too many to make you feel whole. \n \"i need someone \n who knows struggle \n as well as i do \n someone \n willing to hold my feet in their lap \n on days it is too difficult to stand\" \n Her interpretation of love is very physical as well. I was longing for more emotional depth. I progressed but could not find it and this really disappointed me. \n \"if you were born with \n the weakness to fall \n you were born with \n the strength to rise\" \n Having said that, there were a few poems I really enjoyed as you can see by my choice of excerpts for this review. Rupi's second book, The Sun and her Flowers, will be released on the 3rd of October. Will I still give it a go? Yes of course; surprise me Rupi. Good surprise. \n In the meantime, let's appreciate this beautiful prose, my favourite one from Milk and Honey: \n \"you are the faint line \n between faith and \n blindly waiting \n - letter to my future lover\"","date":"2016-07-03"}

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":4,"review_text":"I never know how to properly review non-prose. I'm so terrible at it. This is a lyrical work - both poetic and critical according to its Wikipedia page. It doesn't really matter what it is, and if one is overly concerned about the mode then they probably weren't really reading it. \n I have heard many a great thing about Claudia Rankine's work but this is something I will probably read again. The best thing about this is that there are \"clear\" parts -as in, less obviously poetic and more anecdotal and then there are poetic, abstract parts. But all of them are difficult to digest. See the beautiful thing about that is sometimes seemingly simple anecdotes are not and cannot be easily digestible and that tension is evident in Citizen . \n This is also a multimedia text, in a way that's not obnoxious. What I mean is that Claudia incorporates different media - art, photographs, murals - in a way that makes sense but is of course jarring. There is nothing comfortable about this text and it is not supposed to be comfortable to read. I think another thing that is good about it is that I am not sure anyone besides the author herself could come away reading it having not learned something new. Even as a black woman who could relate to certain sentiments, this text does not rely on cliches and hackneyed understandings of stereotypes (for example). This may be partially because of the format and also because Rankine is a damn good writer.","date":"2016-02-19"}

{"book_id":"1381","rating":3,"review_text":"While reading I tried to image a world where the gods existed, interacted, and heavily influenced the everyday. Like when I'm watering plants, which god would I pray to, or while traveling which god would I sacrifice a goat, cow, and boar towards. This includes the methods and rituals in these processes. How would I know if I had appeased the gods. \n When I was growing up, my mother would tell me that the person who just helped me was an angel. I can distinctly remember a time at the airport when someone helped carry our luggage to the car- helping us tremendously- and then when we went to find them to say goodbye they were no where to be seen. Again, my mother was certain that that was an experience with an angel. (I believed her because I was 9.) \n In this book the characters are often avatars of the deities manifesting in different guises. Ushering them here, or whispering permanent plot information there. Further they would cast 'spells' or 'miracles' on the protagonist from time to time. In this light, this allows for convenient writing. (What you want when you need it, rather than building the proper scaffolding within the narrative.) \n Then, I tried to imagine a society in which it was important and necessary to create these deities- it makes sense as it was moving from animism. There are tendencies to see 'god,' still today in the overtly religious. Anything and everything (though mostly beautiful or stuff that leaves these individuals with feelings of awe or ignorance) is attributed to 'god.' It's not that I don't see these things, its just that I see them through the lens of no god at all. Sickening truth is that the ugly things are also attributed to gods as well. Even in the book, from the perspective of the men on the ship that were torn apart by the sea beast (~2000 y/o spoiler!) the actions of the gods are also terrible. The violent pictures and videos that permeate our world now are also actions of the gods. It all applies. \n I don't know a lot of mythology, just the big ones. I was surprised at how intertextual the entire thing was. It was interesting to be only partially aware of the allusion made throughout the story. For me the interesting moments in the book were how each major was like a turducken of story. Every conversation was an opportunity to further the narrative of the journey and connect with it the mythologies of the day! \n I was interested when Odysseus and his son did not mess around when they got back/together in the house! They cleaned house in a very real way. Even the ladies were put to the sword. Ton said, \"Yeah... the greeks never went half way in their stories.\" \n The story ends on a surprisingly sweet note with his father, and I couldn't help but see the oral tradition within the written text as the story was reframed three times, it's third time while reciting the epic to his own father. This threepeat allows for the solidification of the story in the listeners head- so that she can tell it to someone else from memory. \n I read this so that I could immediately make the connotative allusions that crop up all of the time in contemporary life. And right away Stephen Colbert told a story where he refers to the Odyssey. It's a sweet story, and while his telling of the sneeze blessing is a bit incorrect (at least in the version I read) it's still a poignant affirmation of my own rationale. http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/... \n Wanna watch o brother where art thou again to make the connections- but just watched \"Hail, Caesar!\" and man was it beautifully boring.

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":4,"review_text":"\"The purpose of art is to lay bare the questions hidden by the answers.\" \n James Baldwin \n In Citizen: An American Lyric Rankine's prose reads more like a political essay than lyrical poetry. However, her accounts expose prejudice both large and small. \n She deals head on with atrocities that have been deemed fit for American headlines - \n The Jena 6, Trayvon Martin, \n Hurricane Katrina, \n Have you seen their faces? \n we are drowning here \n still in the difficulty \n as if the faces in the images hold all the consequences \n and the fiction of the facts assumes randomness and indeterminacy \n He said, I don't know what the water wanted. It wanted to show you no one would come. \n The objectification of blacks, \n Micro-aggressions that are usually ignored, glossed over, stuffed deep down inside, \n https://racialmicroaggressions.files.... \n -\t\t-\t- but usually not forgotten. \n Rankine's is a powerful voice; daring to ask the questions that we think but often don't say aloud. \n \"That time and that time and that time the outside blistered the inside of you, words outmaneuvered years, had you in a chokehold, every part roughed up, the eyes dripping. That's the bruise the ice in the heart was meant to ice. \n What did you say? \n You think maybe this is an experiment and you are being tested or retroactively insulted or you have done something that communicates this is an okay conversation to be having. \n Why do you feel comfortable saying this to me? \n \"As usual you drive straight through the moment with the expected backing off of what was previously said. It is not only that confrontation is headache-producing; it is also that you have a destination that doesn't include acting like this moment isn't inhabitable, hasn't happened before, and the before isn't part of the now as the night darkens and the time shortens between where we are and where we are going.\" \n Did I hear what I think I heard? \n \"Being around black people is like watching a foreign film without translation.\" \n \"The man at the cash register wants to know if you think your card will work. If this is his routine, he didn't use it on the friend who went before you. As she picks up her bag, she looks to see what you will say. She says nothing. You want her to say something - both as witness and as a friend. She is not you; her silence says so.\" \n \"Someone in the audience asks the man promoting his new book on humour what makes something funny. His answer is what you expect - context. After a pause he adds that if someone said something, like about someone, and you were with your friends you would probably laugh, but if they said it out in public where black people could hear what was said, you might not, probably would not. Only then do you realize you are among \"the others out in public\" and not among \"friends\". \n The past is a life sentence, a blunt instrument aimed at tomorrow.","date":"2016-01-10"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"This review has been originally posted on writingsfromhell. \n \"i am water \n soft enough \n to offer life \n tough enough \n to drown it away\" \n I'm simply not the type of person who reads poetry. I never liked it in school and certainly did not enjoy it when I tried to read it again at a later age. So the encounter with Milk and Honey by Rupi Kaur was somehow ill-fated from the beginning. I picked this book up because there was such a rouse over it on the social medias and I thought to myself \"why not give it a try?\". And this is how the love story between poetry and a strong-headed but sometimes too emotional girl started. \n I was swept away by how raw and strong this work of art is. I needed not more than an hour to read all of the poems - even if I had wanted to stop and devour them one after another, it would not have been possible. The words were so full of emotion and the meaning behind them is so important. You might ask to whom? To everyone. But especially to us women. Especially to women and girls who are still trying to find their way in this mess of a life. Especially to all of us who are still growing. Because the poems deal with so many important topics like trauma, love, loss, healing and femininity. \n What I liked about Milk and Honey was the simple fact that it was so minimalistic - and I adore this kind of aesthetic. The cover and every second page were adorned with complimentary drawings. And the poems themselves were short, but incisive. They all told different stories but were all so fitting. Sometimes they were whispering, sometimes they were screaming at me. But all the time it was like they wanted to tell me that they know. That they had been where I am now. That they know how I am feeling. And a promise that this will be over soon. \n What made me happy was the fact that I could actually recommend it to somebody - I want to tell the whole world about it, but that's not what I meant. Since not many of my friends are from the reading folk, I was so much more impressed by the fact that my best friend wants to read it for herself after I told her about the book and showed her some of the poems. It fills me with honour and so much happiness that I cannot grasp it or put it into words. \n \"you were a dragon long before \n he came around and said \n you could fly \n you will remain a dragon \n long after he's left\" \n You don't know how much I love the above mentioned poem. After a time where I didn't felt particularly strong or loved myself, this one spoke to me on a whole new level. It made me overthink myself and it had me smiling at the end. Because Rupi speaks true with that - I am strong without someone else and should not define myself by what another person says. I need to learn to believe in myself first. And that's a pretty good lesson from a piece of literature I never intended to read. By now I am incredibly grateful that I decided to pick up Milk and Honey out of sheer curiosity and read it. \n After I was heartbroken for the first time in my life - like my first real heartbreak - it wasn't easy for me to recollect myself. I dealt with it for over a year and couldn't quite quit the suffering I put myself in. But after reading Milk and Honey I am once again impressed at how wonderful literature can be and how much it can help in dealing with your life. I find myself picking up the book every now and then, sometimes even more than once on a notably hard day. I just flip through the pages, looking for some words that will comfort me. And I'm never let down, always drawing strength from them. \n So this book is easily one of my favourite books I'd recommend to everyone who asks. It now has a place on my nightstand so I can grab it whenever I need it the most. I just want to thank Rupi for expressing her own feelings in words. For publishing this stunning book. For making me feel less alone with me feelings and more understood. Thank you for Milk and Honey.","date":"2016-12-19"}

{"book_id":"18003300","rating":3,"review_text":"**2.5-3 \n A quick, light read. There were a few poems that made me think \"holy crap, that was brutal,\" but destined soulmates or devestatingly unrequited love are predominant themes, which are both horribly angsty topics to spend so much time on. I'm also not a big fan of the sing-songy writing style, but that's just personal preference.

It was exactly what I needed to read in this exact moment in my life, and I don't think I would have appreciated it nearly as much even just a week ago. So, admittedly, my high rating may largely be due to superb timing, but there were multiple poems that I loved on a purely objective level too. I really like how there are no capital letters and minimal punctuation, so it's almost entirely the reader's job to place emphasis and create meaning <3 Interactive and experimental texts are always an interesting experience for me, but they are definitely not everyone's cup of tea ^.^ \n Very few poems elicited no response from me at all. There was lots of crying (some internal, some external), some laughter, and several \"amen\"s. So many of these poems are utterly thought-provoking, almost entirely dealing with male-female relationships and some with female-female relationships. They put words to ideas that resonate with my heart, yet her words and phrases are so simple yet so aesthetic. Poetry--and literature in general--doesn't have to be a complex and convoluted mystery to be beautiful <3","date":"2016-09-21"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"I appreciate Kaur's strength, bluntness, and feminism, but the poetry itself in Milk and Honey is pretty underwhelming.

I'm glad I did finish it, if only to understand the cultural impact it's made, but next time I want to read writing like this I'll just get on tumblr. \n But, as Kaur writes in one of the final poems in this book, \"your art is not about how many people like your work...your art is about if your soul likes your work. it's about how honest you are with yourself.\" This book was not for me. It was first for the writer and second for anyone who can find solace in her words. You do you, Rupi Kaur.","date":"2016-06-30"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"Rating: 4/5 stars \n Genre: Poetry \n \"who tricked you / into believing / another person / was meant to complete you / when the most they can do is complement\" \n \"i want to be full on my own / i want to be so complete / i could light a whole city / and then / i want to have you / cause the two of us combined / would set it on fire\" \n This book felt like a poetic companion to Colleen Hoover's It Ends with Us. The first of the four sections, \"the hurting,\" related mostly to abuse within the family, and that was tough to read. The following sections were \"the loving,\" \"the breaking,\" and \"the healing.\" Each section focused on a different aspect of loving and living. \n I enjoyed this book, but I will say it's not PG. The illustrations, though not terribly detailed, are sexual and some of the written content is sexual. (Just a disclaimer for younger readers who want to rush out and pick up this major poetic hit that's flying off the shelves.) \n But this book isn't just about sex. It's about learning to love and accept yourself so that you can love and accept others. This can apply to anyone, but Kaur directs this message specifically to women. And I think it's an essential message to hear in today's culture when women are objectified and competing with one another to reach unobtainable standards. \n I love how Kaur admonishes the reader to respect her body: \"he placed his hands / on my mind / before reaching / for my waist.\" Amen, sister Rupi. Preach it. She encourages women to wait for the guy your mother said was worth it: \"no / it won't / be love at / first sight when / we meet it'll be love / at first remembrance cause / i've seen you in my mother's eyes / when she tells me to marry the type / of man i'd want to raise my son to be like.\" That's wisdom right there. \n She also speaks out about treating others right, even if they don't deserve it: \"some people / are so bitter / to them / you must be kindest.\" And, \"it takes grace / to remind kind / in cruel situations.\" \n I also love how Kaur discusses pain and how hope can come from hurt: \"stay strong through your pain / grow flowers from it,\" and \"the world / gives you / so much pain / and here you are / making gold out of it / - there is nothing purer than that.\" \n Quite a deep read, for a quick read.","date":"2017-01-25"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"2016 was the year I redescovered poetry. I had a great Intro to Literary Studies teacher who brought several amazing poems for us to analyze and that prompted me to reach out for more. I read both classic and contemporary authors and wondered endlessly at how anyone could be so talented as to play with words in such a way. Even the ones that did not resonate with me as much, I found interesting in a way... \n Until now. \n I am infuriated that this was my first book of the year, what kind of precedent does this set? UGH. \n Anyways. This review will not be very original as there have been lots of people who have expressed a similar sentiment, but here I am adding to the raging pot of disappointed readers (and buyers!) nonetheless. \n This is bad poetry. Period. I have seen some people saying that this seems as a script for Kaur's spoken poetry and that is fine but if you are going to publish something, then make sure it's a good read ON PAPER. I'm so sick of this excuse of \"if you'd seen it performed\"... WHAT BS!! Great writing is great anyhow, or I wouldn't be having Shakespeare in my third year of Uni. \n Another comment about comments, Free Verse is NOT just sentences randomly cut, as these seem to be. Yes, Free Verse is a little more liberal with metrics, BUT that does not mean clumsy clunky awkward writing as this was. I often was put off by the cuts of the \"verses\", the rhythm was off and it read that way. \n Also, it is not that the poems are short, it is that there is no point to most of them. They feel incomplete, like random ideas you would scribble on your notebook while in a boring class. There are plenty of great examples of brief wonderful poems... hell, even stories! (Six word stories, anyone? What about Haikus, hmm?) So yeah. Again, I know there must be effort put here, but it certainly doesn't feel like it. It's effortless in the worst way imaginable. \n Why, then, this seems to be so many people's favorite poetry collection? Well, because IT IS EASY. The themes are intense, dramatic, relevant, not to mention relatable; and they are put forward in a way that lacks any subtlety and artistry so everyone can understand exactly what she is telling you. So, I'm happy if this touched you in any way, but sadly that does not make this poetry collection any good. \n Finally, to all the people that are offended by other people calling this \"tumblr poetry\"... Well, if it reminds so many people of it, then what else can it be? Honestly, I have seen better pieces of writing there. This book has the kind of phrases you share on social media and that's not bad, but don't expect me to condone it on a \"collection of poems\". \n On a side note, the drawings were gorgeous and if this had been marketed as an artbook (with minimum text, of course), then maybe it would have been a better read.","date":"2016-09-02"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"I've been seeing Rupi Kaur's book in almost all the social networking sites. I read reviews, nice and lovely ones. I was so glad that gave it a try. \n Milk and Honey, so far, is the best book that I've read this year. It is a collection of powerful poems and prose about love, healing, abuse, etc. Every poem struck my heart. Though some was too short, I loved it. It was a really quick-read, one that won't let you stop feeling things even at its end. Rupi's writing was captivating and moving. \n Even the illustrations were exquisite, but mind you guys, you may either like or dislike the illustrations since it needs a bit of open-mindedness. \n Here are some of my favorites: \n \"it is your blood \n in my veins \n tell me how I'm \n supposed to forget\" \n \"love will come \n and when love comes \n love will hold you \n love will call your name \n and you will melt \n sometimes though \n love will hurt you but \n love will never mean to \n love will play no games \n cause love knows life \n has been hard enough already\" \n \"more than anything \n i want to save you \n from myself\" \n \"you look at me and cry \n everything hurts \n i hold you and whisper \n but everything can heal\"","date":"2017-01-14"}

I got this yesterday and read it all in one sitting (which wasn't hard, as some pages just have one sentence, but at least I read something!). I'm having a hard time reading actual books at the moment (a.k.a, why I haven't been posting as much *sadface*). \n BUT!!!! \n This'll be a mini review because (as I said above) it's so freaking hard to put my love into words!!!!!!!! HaLp! \n Theme \n Soooo this book brought up the theme of feminism a lot, and I think that it really did the topic justice. It had me in tears many times. My favorite part was The Healing part of the book because I agree/relate to everything the author was writing about. \n Just \n Actually, this book did bring up many \"forbidden\" topics such as rape, and handled everything so so well. A part of the book was slightly dark (which can be understood, obviously), but I loved the closure and how everything seemed to be resolved (which isn't the word I was looking for, but eh) in a positive light. \n In other words: \n SuPeR eMpOwErInG! \n Writing \n This review is literally the hardest one I've ever written because I loved every part of it that I have no idea what to say. The writing? Absolutely gorgeous. The message? Absolutely gorgeous. The illustrations? Freaking fantastic! \n But in all seriousness, the writing made me so happy. Some of the poems were simple, but that's what made it all the more powerful. \n I actually read some out loud to my dad (who doesn't normally read), and he enjoyed it, so if that doesn't tell you how good it is, I dunno what will. \n Anywho! Thank you for reading this extremely mini-review! Just know that the book was beautiful and that you should definitely go read it. \n Let me know what you thought in the comments below!","date":"2016-11-28"}

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":3,"review_text":"An ambitious, experimental, and important read. I am glad I chose to read this book, and to engage with the critical subject matter. Some pieces are simply heartbreaking. The first section was particularly strong. However I did not encounter a coherent emotional arc for the book as a whole, rather what felt to me to be disjointed sections. Some of these worked well as stand alone pieces and some did not. The mixture of essay-prose-poetry-script and more was intriguing but again did not seem to reinforce the strong message and theme of the book. Overall it is well worth reading - it is such an unusual book that is it hard to predict how someone might react to it, so read it and see for yourself.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"Don't get me wrong, I liked this one. It's very much a female-empowering book, preaching us to love ourselves and to complete our own self. That's the thing, though: preaching. Sometimes it felt like Rupi Kaur was trying too hard to make this the feminist book she wanted it to be. Sometimes, I liked it; there are certain lines stuck in my brain. Sometimes I couldn't understand what the fuss is all about. \n For a poetry book, it's not really that poetic -- especially when read almost back-to-back with Shinji Moon's The Anatomy of Being. It very much pales in comparison, but yet again, they're both separate entities. milk and honey feels more like a notebook of random and unfinished thoughts at times, that you read them, and feel like you're missing a couple of lines. Another thing that irked me: THE LACK OF PUNCTUATION. JESUS CHRIST, THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT POETIC OR ORIGINAL AT ALL, JUST ANNOYING. \n Alright, this sounds like a review for something I completely disliked, but I didn't, honestly, and if I'll get the chance, I will read again. \n Let me leave you with a few of my favourite lines: \n i) she was a rose in the hands of those who had no intention of keeping her \n ii) that is the thing about selfish people. they gamble entire beings. entire souls to please their own. \n iii) I know I should crumble for better reasons \n but have you seen that boy he brings \n the sun to its knees every night My favourite one.","date":"2016-07-01"}
{"book_id":"269322","rating":3,"review_text":"I genuinely think if Poe had been born in our times, he would have been a hit. Like a pop hit. Tumblr-famous hit. He would be the My Chemical Romance of the modern poetry. Lines of his poetry would be all across Tumblr, maybe even make it to Twitter. There would be aesthetics based on his lines, and he'd be the saviour of the emos. \n All jokes aside about his emo, I mean, brooding poetry: Poe had skill, form and he was gifted with metaphors. He was fantastic with descriptions, and this is the reason why I'm making fun of him; because I secretly wish my brain could spill beautiful descriptions like his. \n Here are some of my favourite lines: \n But we loved with a love that was more than love- \n There fell a silvery-silken veil of light, \n With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber, \n Stable, opaque, immortal-all by dint, \n Of the dear names that lie concealed within't. \n I legit just almost got paper cut from going through the pages, so quote I shall no more. \n But seriously; it feels a bit like a moral duty to at least have read Poe once in your life, so if you ever feel pretty emo, crank it up a notch with some Poe. \n Props to my favourite emo. No hard feelings, Poe, I only pick on people I love.","date":"2016-06-28"}

Regardless, I'm not an expert on this style of writing, but I still believe that this collection was brave and raw and just real. It put words to feelings that many young men and women may be feeling but are unable to express. \n It's hard to summarize these feelings into one review since some of the pieces were so vastly different, and I hate to give excerpts as they would essentially be spoiling the book.

{"book_id":"1381","rating":5,"review_text":"I have decided to devote this summer's reading to those books that I am embarrassed not to have read up to this point. Perhaps a vain way of deciding what to read, but I figure a reader's initial motivation for picking up a book doesn't matter much, as long as the book is good and the reader attentive. Very near the top of that list--alongside the Bible, Plato's Republic, and, yes, Harry Potter--are the Iliad and the Odyssey, twin pillars of the epic tradition. \n I read the Odyssey first because I had already read big chunks of it, and I am lazy. Also because today is Bloomsday, the date on which Joyce's parodic-Odyssean novel Ulysses is set. I read the last four books of the Odyssey sitting at the center of the pan-Hellenic monument in Iowa City--the Lincoln Memorial of frats, constructed in the hope for \"unity of thought across the diverse range of Greek life,\" according to the placard. If it makes me any more dateable, the reader should note I did not plan to do so in advance, and that it was just a neat coincidence. \n Anyway, it turns out that the Odyssey is super important and influential. On nearly every page one finds some ur-element, be it a plotline, image, or character archetype, from which everything else you've ever read is to some degree descended. As Melville's Ishmael says of the study of whales (and Melville is a Homeric writer if ever there was one), to read the Odyssey is \"to grope down into the bottom of the sea,\" to \"have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world,\" or at least the world as imagined in 3000-ish years of Western literature. And, as Melville also says: \"this is a fearful thing.\" \n It is most fearful in the last 10 lines of the poem, when Odysseus is brought to the brink of madness and rescued only by the intervention of Athena, whose fittingly deus ex machina quality Homer is aware of throughout the poem. Most of the time this awareness is playful (Homer is funny), but in this case the effect is terrifying, as is the ending more generally, a grotesque bloodbath in which the victors quite literally dance on the graves of the slain--or almost literally, since the bodies are fresh and not yet buried. I would be interested in Quaker readings of this poem, as I am sure they would have a thing or two to say about it, with typical Quaker intelligence. \n On a more positive note, I was greatly surprised by the degree to which Joyce's novel meshes with the original, not so much as a one-to-one allegory than as a thematic heightening of everyday experience into sublime epic, or in Wordsworth's terms an attempt to \"breathe grandeur upon the very humblest face of human life.\" As every insufferable English major knows, Joyce attempts this by equating the quotidian activities and desires of Leopold Bloom with the heroic feats of Odysseus. What surprised me is that Homer attempts the same thing, only in reverse: the heroic feats of Odysseus are constantly compared via simile to \"boring\", workaday tasks: fishing, cleaning, leaving the office for the day (really). I started marking them as I read and might cite some examples here, at some point, but seriously, they're all over the place. \n The poem's attention to the non-heroic isn't limited to its similes. For instance, I dare you not to cry when the dog dies. (Yes, there is even a dog that dies. That's how ur- this text is.) Homer's willingness to use the epic as a platform for the weak and the weary, the tired, poor, and huddled, the injured and insulted--and above all, the just plain ordinary--is extraordinarily moving, and for me the poem's most valuable achievement. \n Except the sea monsters. Nothing is going to top that shit. \n Five stars!","date":"2017-06-13"}

{"book_id":"94578","rating":5,"review_text":"Nietzsche never fails to amaze me. He is an engaging, fascinating thinker--a seer actually. The Gay Science is on the mature end of his career, and as applied to Nietzsche, 'career' can only mean occupation with being and becoming more human. There is nothing pedantic, nothing scholastic about it. \n There is a lot to love here. Hardly a page escaped my highlighter. Passage after passage is pregnant with insight, expansive in breadth. There is some to hate here, too--misogyny and anti-humanitarianism perhaps the worst--and from this it is easy to understand Nietzsche's infamy. But I am now convinced no one should hold an opinion of Nietzsche without reading this work. He cannot be known or justly judged through a myopic opprobrium born of offense. There are readings here that have the ability to send any human, of any political, ideological or religious bent, soaring. Many sections read as loftily as Thomas a Kempis' Imitation of Christ or as Augustine's Confessions. Nietzsche is no fan of a Kempis or Augustine, but neither is he enamored of Spinoza or Darwin. He holds equal contempt for them all. He sees a way for himself, and the soaring spirit with which he conceives of that way and the bursting eloquence by which he expresses it approach the ecstasy or revelation of the best of religious experience. The Gay Science, with its 383 sections and its flanking works of poetry, could easily serve as a bible of psalms, proverbs, and epistles, a daily devotional for the \"super faithful,\" as only Nietzsche could conceive. \n Through the pages of The Gay Science I have come most clearly to see why Nietzsche is considered to be a father of existentialism and postmodernism. His critique of rationalism and modernism was before its time; it took half a century for the rest of Western philosophy to catch up with him, and the resonance of his work with my own sensibilities, as those of a child of the current age, more than a century later, bear testimony to the foresight of his intuition. I am both compelled and revulsed. Nietzsche's calling is all-consuming, like that of Christian discipleship, but, dare I say, more true. Yet for this very reason I shudder. I am drawn to so much good here; I hear wisdom passionately calling in the streets. But, too, I am embarrassed to entertain for a moment I understand even the surface of Nietzsche's calling or how it could practically apply to me, or whether I would even want it to. But that is the beauty of it: it is profound; it is repulsive. It is compelling; it is disconcerting. It is universal, but Nietzsche's own. Perhaps hope can lie in the recognition that Nietzsche is not a systematist. His genius obtains in flashes of intuition. A response to what calls in The Gay Science need not understand Nietzsche as he understands himself, or even presume he can be understood. Perhaps all that is needed is to be moved by his voice, for his artistry to find something within to move, to awaken. \n I give The Gay Science five stars. I could only hope Nietzsche would give me any at all, but that would entirely miss his point.","date":"2017-04-04"}

I feel touched, why? \n Most of these short poems did not affect me that way, they felt like long-familiar sentences that made me go 'meh'. But the ones that did affect me, will stay with me.

{"book_id":"22151696","rating":5,"review_text":"I love poetry. Always have. \n However, it's usually the classics that appeal to me (Oscar Wilde, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, the Bronte sisters, some German poets). Nevertheless, sometimes a contemporary poet/poetress manages to speak to me as well. \n Lang Leav was completely unknown to me and had it not been for wonderful poems in Alex's status updates, I probably would have never found out she existed. One of those lucky coincidences because this poetress is a true master! \n Honestly, Lang Leav has a delicate beauty to every line she writes, whether it is in rhymes or not; and although most poems in this collection are about love, it never gets tiresome or monotone. She has a subtle way of getting under your skin and waking slumbering emotions (locked away or forgotten). It's as if this book had been written just for me. \n A few examples: \n Her Words \n Love a girl who writes \n and live her many lives; \n you have yet to find her, \n beneath her words of guise. \n Kiss her blue-inked fingers, \n forgive the pens they marked. \n The stain of your lips upon her - \n the one she can't discard. \n Forget her tattered memories, \n or the pages others took; \n you are her ever after - \n the hero of her book. \n No Other \n There is a moment I keep in my heart - I love him and no one else. It is a love that will die with me. \n You may ask, death could be some time away - what if from now to then, you love someone new? \n Well, I can tell you, there is only one love. If any person claims to have loved twice in all their life - they have not loved at all. \n A Pilgrimage \n Always seeking, \n each moment fleeting; \n this is where \n my soul will rest. \n With you I've fulfilled, \n our destined meeting; \n my tired hand, \n against your chest. \n This is the heart, \n that keeps mine beating - \n these are the eyes \n that mine know best. \n The book is divided into three chapters called \n Duet \n Interlude \n Finale \n and ends with an Encore. \n At the end, there is also a little information about the author that I could not have put in better words: \n \"The work of poet and artist Lang Leav swings betwen the whimsical and woeful, expressing a complexity beneath its childlike facade.\" \n And yes, that means that the above included art was drawn by the poetress herself. \n I will definitely get her other book that will be published in November and maybe even her first, just to complete the collection.

{"book_id":"15997","rating":4,"review_text":"Paradise Lost is definitely a book that I want to read again. I read this book in school first so my review will primarily be a history lesson on why this book became. \n It is a book that a lot of people have confused with real events, but I like the concept of having Lucifer have more human nature before the fall. There is so much background of the story as well that made me appreciate the book that much more. Seeing as the book was written during a time when the freedom speech was not a well known practice Milton indirectly used this novel to compare the heavenly revolt against the angels to the English Civil Wars of 1642. \n England was divided in the 1640s between two political groups; the Royalists and Parliamentarians. \n The Royalists consisted of a group of people who supported King Charles I absolute power. \n Milton was among the Parliamentarians who believed that the country should be governed by Parliament and the King's Power should not be absolute. \n Milton was very much politically involved during his time. He stood in strong opposition against absolutists like Richard Lovelace and Thomas Hobbes who were the opposing contemporaries of his time. \n After Beheading King Charles I, the Parliamentes set out to have parliament govern the nation, but their plan failed and the monarchy was restored by his son King Charles II. \n Milton essentially fell from paradise and was thrown in prison for several years of his life \n When he was released he wrote Paradise Lost \"in honor of the King\" \n Milton used \"Paradise Lost\" as an opportunity to share a political message against the monarchy of England and utilized Lucifer to be the promethean hero who brought consciousness to man. \n Of course in a Christian light Lucifer will always be the villain, but in paradise lost he plays the role of the anti-hero \n Lucifer, the light bearer who defied the king of heaven, who was damned for attempting to equal god, cursed our 1st human ancestors and thus tainted us forever with the mark of sin. But perhaps this is not so.... \n When looking at how similar Lucifer is to Milton it can be perceived that Lucifer is a sympathetic character who is trying to give human kind consciousness to the tyrannical rule of God. \n The fact that we both fell and that the fall of man is introduced in book I first, the reader is already set up a relation to the protagonist. \n In Lines 755-757 a solemn council of demons discuss the next plan of action after being expelled from paradise. This parallels the rule of heaven and its absolute monarchy. Here Lucifer and his followers can be viewed as the 'roundheads'; supporters of parliament who fought against King Charles I.","date":"2016-07-03"}

{"book_id":"1420","rating":5,"review_text":"** spoiler alert ** \n This popular play of Shakespeare's is about a prince of Denmark who uncovers a heinous plot concerning his father's death. The scandals and emotional turmoil throughout the plot unfold for a an amazing story in a horrible way! I put off anything written by Shakespeare when I was younger because I thought his works were depressing and difficult to read. While many of these plays are depressing and difficult, such as Hamlet, I have found a new appreciation for them. \n The plot was well done; I loved how interconnected every character and event was to each other. For example, you have Hamlet wrestling internally whether his dad's ghost was right or wrong and how to expose his step-dad and mother in their scandal, seeming to fake madness in light of it all (or at points was it real? I wasn't quite sure, but obviously he was angry). Moving on from there his mother is repentant but now his step-dad wants to kill him, and he fails. Hamlet's girlfriend goes nuts and kills herself and then Hamlet is upset. Her brother wants to kill him and hatches a plot with the king, and then as he dies he regrets it all. The queen dies at the hands of her new husband due to a poison intended for Hamlet and Hamlet ends up killing him for killing her. \n I could relate to the characters and was drawn emotionally into the story; the plot was so exciting and intense.

Hughes tackled myriad issues throughout his lifetime without apology. His language, though lyrical, is also often blunt and leaves little to interpretation though it invokes intense imagery at times. I felt a wide range of emotions as I read The Collected Poems of Langston Hughes. The poems depicted a life I'll never life while offering insight into the reality of others in a way that forced me to think about my own existence in the world and how I interact with those around me. Authenticity rings through Hughes's work even when he paints moments that feel a bit fantastical. I took my time reading these poems because many are intense and require thought while others are lighthearted observations on life.

I'm sorry, but I don't think it deserved the huge hype. \n I admit that Kaur is a bold and very honest writer. This was her truth in the pages and I greatly appreciated that she spoke about all the hurt, the beauty, and how to endure life's cruelties. It was as if she was holding my heart in her hand and squeezing it. \n But the writing wasn't that impressive. I didn't like the idea that every line in the poems started in lowercase letters. Also, her choice of words weren't that exquisitely weaved. They were too simple for my liking. The concepts of most of the poems were things that you could've easily read from Facebook pages and tumblr posts. They seemed unoriginal and derivative. \n Here's an example: \n \"sex takes the consent of two \n if one person is lying there not doing anything \n cause they are not ready \n or not in the mood \n or simply don't want to \n yet the other is having sex \n with their body it's not love \n it is rape\" \n Despite my negative views on it, I admit that this is a good book to read when you're feeling down and are in need of a friend.

It further reinforced my belief of putting yourself first and learning how to love yourself on your own. Although it's a challenge I myself still struggle with on most days, the poems made me remember that being able to fully love yourself can reflect on the way you love others too. You can't be broken and expect someone else's love to fix that and heal you perfectly. You can't replace self-love with someone else's love. It's like putting a band-aid on an open cut without even cleaning or treating the wound won't make it disappear or heal completely. It covers it temporarily until that band-aid gets ripped off and you realise the problem still lies underneath it all. You'll then realise that you've been depending on that band-aid for so long to conceal the pain, the same way you've been depending on someone this whole time to make you feel better. You have to learn how to make yourself feel better on your own. \n This was definitely a lot better than the previous poetry book I read which was The Princess Saves Herself in this One. Both deal with the same subject-matter, but I feel that Rupi Kaur's choice of words and the way she conveys her messages with such depth and meaning, all whilst maintaining a simple & concise structure made me appreciate this more than Amanda Lovelace's poetry.

{"book_id":"1420","rating":5,"review_text":"This was my fifth Shakespeare, and it will probably always remain my favourite. I apologize for this long, seemingly directionless review. I'm not even sure where I was going with it, or where I ended up going, but here goes. \n As is pretty evident to anyone who has read this play, Hamlet is a problematic play, in the sense that it isn't your normal Shakespeare. That is not to say that it cannot be characterized as a normal Shakespearean tragedy; it can. But in its very essence there is something in it which proves to be incomprehensible, which adds to it an element of surprise. It really is an enigma - an entirely unpredictable enigma. No other tragedies of Shakespeare (at least of the ones that I have read) have the same capacity of bewildering the readers/spectators as Hamlet does. \n Shakespeare brings to us an unsolvable riddle through Hamlet. After his first encounter with the ghost - that merciless vision, which, I believe, should be held responsible for all the ruined lives, enter as it did in them only to wreak havoc - Hamlet is expected to act. To do something. And yet all that the play seems to reflect on is his failure to do so - without Shakespeare specifying any reason for it. When it comes to this play, it's not the plot that matters. At least I thought so. This is where it diverges from the ordinary Shakespeare. And I may be talking utter preposterous nonsense here, but dare I suggest that this play has some modernist elements? Well, I've already said it. Let me explain where I'm coming from. \n Firstly, Hamlet is more about characterization, it seems to me, than anything else. The problem itself lies in Hamlet's personality. One of the reasons for Hamlet's inaction can be chalked up to his being weak-willed, irresolute, and lacking courage. Another reason can be attributed to the many obstacles in his way of seeking revenge. But I cannot help but align myself with a completely different line of thought. Hamlet is of a highly cultivated mind, and more than anything else, a very intellectual person with an extremely philosophical bend of mind. Isn't it really just that which time and again makes him pause and reflect and consider a certain action? \n Before the appearance of the ghost his spirit has been wounded by a sudden blow. He has already begun to question \"all the uses of this world,\" on the \"unweeded garden\" that he fain would leave to be possessed by \"things rank and gross in nature.\" Then comes the dread vision, with its appalling revelation, which lays on him a responsibility greater than his nature can bear. And this vision, as I said earlier, is what I think starts the process of ruin in the lives of all the characters. The vision creates in Hamlet a mental disturbance, not that he actually goes mad, though, of course, he does pretend to, perhaps because that was not only a strategy but also the only way he could deal with what he had to deal with. The only fault Hamlet has lies in the excess of his intellect. His derangement is the mental derangement of a noble, but not really a heroic, nature, sinking beneath a burden which it cannot bear and must cast away. The only reason why Hamlet cannot simply seek revenge, as you would expect of a Shakespearean hero, is that he isn't one. His fault is that he is too intellectual for his own good. \n And that's where the modernist element becomes visible, too. With his mind horribly disturbed with thoughts beyond mortal reach, Hamlet is constantly involved in a modernist struggle with himself as he seeks answers to the questions raised by his troubled life. Even the way he talks of himself has modernist notions attached to it: \n 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, \n Nor customary suits of solemn black, \n Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, \n No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, \n Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage, \n Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, \n That can denote me truly. These indeed \"seem,\" \n For they are actions that a man might play. \n But I have that within which passeth show, \n These but the trappings and the suits of woe. \n And then there is the everlasting 'To be or not to be' soliloquy, of course. His soliloquies also seem very similar to the stream of consciousness technique, serving the purpose of both artistically displaying Hamlet's mental involvements and raising modernist questions. There's also a strong sense of pessimism that can be traced throughout the play - another proof to my claim. \n I may be completely out of whack with this modernist talk, but the complexity of Hamlet's character itself is undeniable. And so is that of the reaction it is capable of producing in us - in me. Hamlet's behavior towards Ophelia, for example, is entirely reproachable, and, for that matter, so is his behavior towards Gertrude. He seems to be too overwhelmed by his own sorrow to care about anyone else, and I would invoke a feminist debate right about here were it not for the fact that somehow Hamlet's behavior seems to me much more nuanced than simply misogynist or sexist, although it would be naive to say that it is not that too. But presented as he is thus by Ophelia, it is clear that Hamlet is simply letting go: \n He took me by the wrist, and held me hard; \n Then goes he to the length of all his arm; \n And with his other hand thus o'er his brow, \n He falls to such perusal of my face, \n As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so; \n At last,--a little shaking of mine arm, \n And thrice his head thus waving up and down, \n He raised a sigh so piteous and profound, \n That it did seem to shatter all his bulk, \n And end his being. That done, he lets me go; \n And, with his head over his shoulder turned, \n He seem'd to find his way without his eyes; \n For out o' doors he went without their help, \n And, to the last, bended their light on me. \n From the moment the ghost placed the burden he did on Hamlet, everyone's - including Ophelia's - fates became entwined with Hamlet's. Hamlet can no longer have the same preoccupations or even desires he used to have. Under the pressure of his vow that the ghost's injunction should \"live within the volume of his brain, unmix'd with baser matter,\" all else in the world has become to him mean and unimportant. Am I simply trying to justify Hamlet's cruelty? Perhaps. But I cannot help but do it, which in itself is a complexity I cannot figure out. \n I do love the fact, however, that in the end Hamlet remained true to his self. He did not really want to do in order to seek revenge what he was seeking it for in the first place. The criminals are at last punished, as it were, by an accidental blow, which is symbolic of the general ruin of both the guilty and the innocent. \n I will conclude now by simply stating that I really, really loved Hamlet because if I do not stop now I have no idea where I will go with this already too long review. I will now leave this as it is and go watch Haider, a Hindi adaptation of Hamlet by Vishal Bharadwaj.","date":"2017-02-13"}
{"book_id":"1371","rating":3,"review_text":"3.5 stars. \n I totally get why 'The Iliad' is an important text. Historical value or not, it does have literary value. I mean, obviously. Even with all the diverse views regarding its authorship, it is still an immensely significant piece of literature. Whether it is a part of an oral tradition, composed by many bards, singers, etc, or truly an authentic masterpiece by Homer, the fact remains that it forms the basis for and solidifies the epic tradition. It's a huge work with so many stories, and so many characters with such personality traits and imperfections that even the gods appear to be humane; and borrowed from earlier tradition or not, to merge it all into one huge, sprawling work is definitely something. It is, of course, timeless in terms of its major themes. The pursuit of glory and honour still drives our political, social, and economical lives. The themes of mortality, death, fate, and most important, war are also still relevant. \n Having said all of that, however, I also need to be honest about my reading experience. I did not particularly enjoy it, and I'm not even thinking of all the sexism when I say that (which, of course, was to be expected, I suppose). It was a slow read. And it was a difficult read. And one that didn't really give me anything. When I started reading it, my reason for starting in the first place was that I thought it was important reading, and that is the only reason I didn't leave it unfinished. I realize its importance and significance, but I also realize that all I personally got from it is that I'm no longer ignorant of the events it talks of, which, (in this age) I did not really need to read the text for. I don't know if that justifies it, or if I'm simply not seeing something here, but for now, that is why I am giving it only 3.5 stars. \n Maybe I'd feel differently if I ever revisit it in the future. I don't know. I do know, however, that I'm really grateful right now that my course at uni didn't require me to opt for the classical Greek lit paper.","date":"2016-11-08"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"Man, I truly wanted to write a convincing review detailing WHY I think this collection of poems is nothing but mediocre. But I see a lot of other good reviews saying the exact same thing so I'm going to spare my time. \n I know that poetry takes entire hold of one's soul and can make one feel so powerful an emotion that it can never be replicated. Rupi Kaur clearly empathizes with her own poems. They may even have been wrought out of her own experience (in which case, I feel extremely sorry for her). But emotion cannot make up for artistry. \n Secondly, I do not like it when the writing is obviously intended to shock the reader. It is an overused and cheap technique, easily mistaken for inventiveness. Not everything that is outrageous is creative or new. \n This is not to say that Rupi has no talent for poetry. There is a powerful dimension of feeling into which she could learn to dig, with the right technique and experience, of course. All in due time.","date":"2017-07-26"}

Consequently, I have read it from the viewpoint of a first-timer, or a virgin.

{"book_id":"15997","rating":5,"review_text":"There is a time for every book, and a book for every time of your life. That's what I tell anyone complaining that they haven't yet managed to read such and such literay masterworks that are considered the cornerstones of humanity. \n I tried to read \"Paradise Lost\" first when I was 15. It didn't seem so impossible; I had read Dostoyevski's \"Crime and Punisment\" at 12, Shakespeare at 13 and Stendhal's \"The Red and The Black\" at 10. (I don't mean to brag; I'm most certainly sure that I've passed by most ideas and important references in those books by reading them at such an early age. I will return to them sometime, with a more mature mind.) \n Coming back to John Milton, I was a little disconcerted when I saw it was a poem. Then I kicked myself in the ass and said I could do it. I had a reputation to keep. \n I abandoned it on page 20. \n When I reached the sweet age of seventeen, about an year ago, I had a lot of unanswered questions about God and religion. I remembered about \"Paradise Lost\". I took it off the shelf, dusted it off, and it had me at page two. \n I saw myself in God, in man, in Satan. I caught a glimpse of me in the angels. I shivered when my own worlds would come out of the devils' mouths, but than I realised that it was a man who had written about them and they couldn't be other than human. The book has a sense of holiness in it, just like the inside of a Roman Catholic cathedral burning with incense. It was like I was given access to some immense cosmic backstage. I'm more than familiar with The Bible, and I've often corrected my teachers on biblical subjects. But \"Paradise Lost\" felt more intimate. I couldn't finish in one go. I kept reading for weeks, and wouldn't want it to end. \n It has some amazing sections of verse, as well as really quotable parts. At times it sounds like a love poem, at others like a prayer or a curse. The language is pure mastery, and there's absolutely no man in the world who wouldn't have something to learn from it, in the literary sense. Take, for example, these verses where the angels in Hell debate which one of them is to scout the new planet God had created: \n \"But first whom shall we send \n In search of this new world, whom shall we find \n Sufficient? Who shall tempt, with wand'ring feet \n The dark unbottomed infinite abyss \n And through the palpable obscure find out \n His uncouth way, or spread his aery flight \n Upborne with indefatigable wings \n Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive \n The happy isle?\" \n (well, don't you already miss that Golden Age of poetry?) \n or this fragment quoted at the beginning of Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" \n \"Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay \n To mould me man? Did I solicit thee \n From darkness to promote me?\" \n It was so good that, even though I never write on books, I stepped over my heart, took a pencil and softly underlined all the best bits. It took a lot of underlining. \n I want to reach a conclusion, before I outwrite myself. \"Paradise Lost\" is a heavy book, and not in the physical way. Everyone ought to read it at some point. \"Awake, arise or be for ever fall'n.\"","date":"2016-04-09"}

I'm glad these teenage girls are rushing to buy this for the sole reason that I feel like most of its messages (NOT all) are very important for a young woman trying to develop a sense of self worth and outward kindness and understanding for their fellow woman,to hear. These poems overflow with feminism and I appreciate that greatly. I want more text that passionately advocates a woman be wholly herself, for herself and considers other women sisters who should be supported. I LOVE that. \n But as a book of poetry, I did not love THIS. Something about today's modern poetry, at least what I've been exposed to and what I see selling at the bookstore I work at, just does. not. do it for me. At all. It's less poetry, more random streams of consciousness. Facebook posts, tumblr posts, tweets in 160 characters or less. I'm not saying poetry has to be any type of way. That's silly. Yet, something just feels lacking and disingenuous for me to call this *poetry*. \n There were a few I quite liked, but they were so few amongst so many that I absolutely didn't enjoy at all, on a personal level. I like poetry that makes me think. That makes me read and reread, whisper in my head and then read out loud. Poems that make me stop and trace the words on the page. I don't like poetry that become a finish line goal to see how quickly I can make it to the end. That's how I was with this book.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"I jumped on the bandwagon and recently picked up a copy of Rupi Kaur's brilliant little book of poetry, Milk and Honey. What is it about, you might ask? Everything important, I'd respond. Especially to girls who are still growing--essentially, all of us women. \n This collection of poems concerns trauma, loss, healing, and femininity. Much like it's cover and title, the whole aesthetic of the book was very minimalist. Each page hosted a different story, and each story was short-spoken yet carried such a imperative reminder. I believe anyone who has gone through pain will be able to relate to Kaur, no matter the gender, age, or scenario. I found myself reading through this book just for the pretty diction. I didn't think I'd get so nostalgic over old wounds. \n It's rare to find a piece of writing that truly grips your heart, as if to say look how similar we are! \n One of my favorite poems is on page 95: \n i didn't leave because \n i stopped loving you \n i left because the longer \n i stayed the less \n i loved myself \n I recently broke up with an amazing boy for the sole purpose of needing to recollect myself before I could give my mind, body, and essence to someone else. This book couldn't have landed in my hands at any better moment. \n It is broken up into four parts, taking us through a journey with Kaur as our narrator. Each chapter tells a different tale of sorrow, but like most awful things there tends to be a self-revolution towards the end. That section (Healing) worked better than any therapy, medicine, or tear stained pillows ever could. \n Literature has proven once more to be the best remedy for heartache.","date":"2016-05-31"}

{"book_id":"22151696","rating":4,"review_text":"Imagine reading a book that will literally lull you to sleep. This book is one of those. I am saying it in a god way though. \n Since it's love month, I decided to delve into another Lang Leav book. Lullabies is Lang Leav's second poetry book, with Love and Misadventure being the first one. I read, enjoyed and reviewed that book and made it to my list of the best books I enjoyed last year. I am not a fan of poems but Lang Leav's works connected to me in a way that I find distinct. I didn't find it hard to immerse and connect myself to her works which is my primary concern with other poem collections. \n Lullabies is a comforting read that provokes emotions. Using a familiar tone and style that he used in her first book, her new one offers a more in-depth discussion of the universal language that is spoken by the world, that is love. One of the reasons why I believe, I didn't find it hard to connect to her books is because of its use of language and writing style that even those who isn't into poetry can enjoy. She writes poems concisely using simple but elaborate language that flows in it's own rhythm. \n The book is thicker than than the first one and features illustrations by Leav herself. The book has three parts: \"Duet,\" \"Interlude\" and \"Finale\" with illustrations accompanying each. The book has a wide array of romantic tales that a variety of people can definitely connect to. The poems are open to interpretations depending on what the readers are currently feeling. It has poems about desires, yearnings, losses of people about love. From love's beginning, to blossoming, the climax, the denouement and the aftermath, the book provokes emotion. The author works wonder with words and she knows how to put her feelings into it. It is very imminent how she writes from the heart and captures different emotions very well. It wont's be a surprise if you find yourself reading a poem that you feel was written for you. \n \"Lullabies\" is good, but I still consider \"Love & Misadventures\" as better. They follow the same style and structure and both are uniquely appealing but I find the latter as more cohesive in structure that the former but nonetheless that opinion does not diminish the fact the this book is a gem. It offers a unique story if read in order but can also be explored by reading randoms bits of it. Nostalgic at times, it is relatable to those who have fallen in love and brokenhearted. \n There are some poems in each collection that veers away from the traditional rules to tell her tales showing how the author is taking the risk which I love from the author. It is also noticeable how this book has more prose weaved into it which could mean that the author is giving the readers a peak to her next works, a novel probably. I'll definitely look forward for the author's next book. \n 4 stars out of 5. \n Cross-posted in my blog: www.bongbongbooks.wordpress.com","date":"2016-02-17"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"I read this book in Walmart this afternoon as I waited for my mother to pick up a prescription. It was priced at $13.97, which is exactly thirteen dollars and ninety-two cents more than this \"book\" is worth. I have heard almost exclusively positive things about this book - granted, it tended to be from very politically liberal women, but I generally trusted these people's reviews on novels, so I went into this collection with some semblance of confidence. Needless to say, I was terribly disappointed. This book did not contain poetry. This book barely contained sentences. While reading it I had the same headache that I do whenever I find myself on a 14-year-old's aesthetic quote blog. I really do not think that Kaur understands how poetry works. You can't just write a sentence, pick a point in the middle, and then hit the return key until it feels right. Every word, punctuation mark, and line break has to serve a purpose either rhythmically or thematically. These \"poems\" did neither. They were just sentences with forced metaphors and similes that had no impact on me whatsoever. I think people like this book because it touches on hot topics and was written by a woman of color, but the point of all poetry is to talk about important topics in an accessible way. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU NEED TO SACRIFICE FORM, STYLE, OR QUALITY. It also does not matter who wrote the poems. If the writing is bad, then the writing is bad. You could tell me that Yeats himself penned these and I would still say they suck. This book isn't special. It isn't unique. I could compile a collection of Tumblr quotes and six-word-stories that would amount to the same level of literary quality as this book. Don't waste your money. My time at Walmart would've been better spend reading the back of a hotdog package.","date":"2017-05-15"}

{"book_id":"1519","rating":3,"review_text":"The Oresteia This was one of those works where I really wish my professor had covered it better in class so that I could fully appreciate it. We had a two hour quick summary-like breeze through all three plays, with more focus being given to \"Agamemnon\" than the other two, so my judgement of the work was based more on how engaging I found it to be as an individual reading experience rather than as a classical work of literature that has been studied and discussed. There is quite a lot to pick out of \"The Oresteia\" that might be a bit overwhelming, as I found it to be, and the lack of guidance and confusion of what to pay attention to and what to make of some of the passages can be an obstacle. Probably with some more time and rereads that won't be necessary, but if one looks and evaluates this just as a piece of literature to sit down with and read, \"The Oresteia\" is quite the rollercoaster in terms of plot, and leaves a rather mixed impression on what to make of it.","date":"2016-11-13"}

But I personally felt too much anger at Achilles and Agamemnon to feel much else for this book. Only Patroclus redeemed \"The Iliad\" a little, and the last chapter with Priam was also nice. Otherwise it was mostly just trying to shove in mini biographies that covered the lineages of characters that are only mentioned once and for a few lines which, like I said, makes sense as a historical catalogue-like piece of writing, but is difficult to get into as a simple read.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"The book, as the image above hints at, is divided into four parts. The first part is \"the hurting\". It is the shortest and the hardest section to read in my opinion as it deals with traumas like rape and the deep hurt caused by an absent father. Kaur has a way with words and pictures (yes, the book is illustrated), expertly choosing the simplest words and lines to create the most powerful combination of poetry and art. The artwork with its minimalistic style reveals more about itself by the spaces it hasn't illustrated, while the poetry- similarly minimal in writing style- fills in the blanks, making you unable to look away from the page. Depending on the context and topic being discussed, the combination of the two can have the delicate effect of a needle and thread ... \n \"you have sadness/living in places/sadness shouldn't live\" \n ... or all the brutality of a hammer and nail: \n \"you were so afraid/of my voice/i decided to be/afraid of it too\" \n The second part, \"the loving\" is a dizzying chapter. It takes the hurt from the last chapter and travels with it. Sometimes it is a burden, sometimes it is a reminder that no matter how loving someone is, hurt is hurt and it cannot be a part of love. This section was the most interesting one for me. The poems were in turn romantic and, well, not. I don't know if that was intentional but it made sense to me: after so much hurt, what does the rest of one's life look like? A lot like this, I guess. \n The next part, \"the breaking\" is pretty self-explanatory. The poems in this section are like jagged glass: they could hurt if you held them wrong but held right, they become pretty handy weapons. \n This section slides, a little bumpily, into the final part of the book: \"the healing\". I honestly don't know what to say about this section without sounding (even more) like a cliched blurb on the back of a book. (The word \"awful\" comes to mind not because it's horrid, but because it's awe inspiring.) I mean, what can I possibly say that can relate how uplifting and just good this part is? I can't. \n Basically, whether you love poetry or you're hesitant about poetry, whether you've only ever had one bad day or you feel like you've never had a good day, milk and honey was written lovingly for you.","date":"2016-08-28"}

Plus I really found some poems irrevelant for the story, it was as if the writer forced us to pity her and her condition in adding some harsh details.

{"book_id":"2547","rating":5,"review_text":"I took my time with this book to savor and enjoy every passage. For me as a writer and Spiritualist, Gibran was using this story of the Prophet Almustafa as he walks in the city of Orphalese as a metaphor for his last journey home. He awaits his ship to take him home, the ship that was coming to get him to take him to the next level or plane and he spoke to life's journey. This is an entire and complete handbook of knowledge as the townspeople come to say goodbye to this wise man...and ask him a myriad of questions as he advises them all about his ideas on love, marriage, children, giving, eating & drinking, work, Joy, Sorrow, houses, clothes, buying & selling, crime & punishment, laws, pain and passion, self knowledge, teaching, friendship, good & evil, prayer, pleasure, beauty, religion and finally Death. Topics on virtually every avenue that life leads us down. He spoke with wisdom and truth very reminiscent of Jesus the Christ and his Earth walk. As I read other reviews I was amazed at the diverse reactions to this book; though not surprised as I myself have had very differing comments about my book...some get it...some do not... Very akin to Jesus' teachings as he walked the streets of Jerusalem, Gibran provides his own spiritual insight and advice on matters of life and how to meet the challenges we all face as human beings. A modern day or 20th Century 'golden rule' analogy book...a handbook to guide and direct the wayward Soul through its Earth walk. All of the various town people wanted to hear what he had to say as a wise old sage and prophet...We so often discount the modern day prophet...like they no longer exist...but of course they do. I will return often to the pages of The Prophet to gain insight and use as a literary guide. An absolute Brilliant literary Masterpiece that has endured the test of time. Bravo Khalil Gibran!!

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"Being a bit hesitant about poetry, for a while I skipped out on reading this book, regardless of some of the four and five star ratings it had received. Poetry has never really been my cup of tea, so anytime I see a book of poems I immediately turn my nose up and move on. This book, though... this book has given me a completely different outlook on the genre. \n I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first started milk and honey. I already had my heart set on not enjoying it, which was totally biased of me and I'm ashamed to have felt that way because I ended up feeling the total opposite. I adored this book! milk and honey is about a woman's struggle for survival. It is full of heartbreak, pain and love, and will have you in tears before it's over. \n The stories inside this book really struck a chord with me. The author tells us of her experiences with rape and molestation, along with many more sensitive topics. Her words reached deep inside me and strummed on my emotions like a harp. I can only imagine what this woman has been through in her life, and for her to have the strength to face those demons with these beautiful, yet painful, words is absolutely amazing to me. \n I happened upon this audiobook as I was looking for a quick read while on a short drive and I think choosing this version of the book played a huge part in my feelings for it. With me being brand new to poetry, I can almost guarantee you that I would've had no clue how to read these poems... meaning I wouldn't have understood them as well I did. Listening to the author speak to us through her poetry brought tears to my eyes and an ache in my soul. \n This was my first experience with poetry, but in no way will it be my last. I have no regrets about taking the time out to read this book, and neither will you if you give it a chance. milk and honey is moving and poignant, and a definite must-read! \n bookslayerReads.com","date":"2016-12-11"}
{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"Rating this piece of work is a hard thing - for it is a collection of poems dealing with loss, love, abuse and feminity. It's a very person thing that tells the poets life so for me to give this one any rating at all seems odd . But I'll justify my 3 stars rating dY\"s \n Now I loved the last third of the book a lot . The poems about feminity, women and growing into your skin were beautiful and very relateable. But all the other topics - abuse, sexuality, loss - I could not find it within myself to relate . Which is , concerning the topics, a good thing I dare say. But when a reader can't relate to the topics dealt within the poems - the writing has to be special... \n So here's comes my second argument as to why I'm only giving 3 stars: many poems seemed to be written texts with keyboard dashes between them \n Don't get me wrong , there were a few very good ones that I highlighted for future references . But that doesn't erase the fact that I found myself shrugging several times throughout reading because I was like ''meh'' \n Maybe it's because Rupi is so popular and I've seen all the good poems on social medial already.

{"book_id":"1420","rating":5,"review_text":"This is a book I have been planning to read for as long as I can remember. I am so glad I finally took the time to check it out. The play is short and easy. I do plan to read many more times to fully understand the plot as it is very intense. \n It is interesting to read the theory's on Hamlet's mental state. Was he crazy or was it an act? To me, it almost seemed to be an act. He wasn't crazy, but he was deeply upset to bare witness to the betrayal of his father. From this unforgiving act, grew an immense hatred towards all women. This is addressed multiple times throughout the play. He cannot get over the fact that his mother has remarried within two months of her husbands death--to his brother no less! This is where Hamlet's views of women starts to waver. He severs his relationship with Ophelia almost immediately instructing her to go to a nunnery, \"Or if thou wilt marry, go; marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.\" He is smarter than most, he sees what becomes of men who fall in love with women, and he choses not to take the same path as his father. He has no faith left in love and answers so much when Ophelia mentions the brevity of the play and his response is, \"As short as woman's love.\" \n The death of Hamlet's father ruined him, it destroyed his family, his relationship with Ophelia and in the end, brought down an entire empire. If I had to go for a moral Shakespeare was trying to convey, I would say the lesson is that even love can bring the most powerful men to their knees.","date":"2017-01-09"}

{"book_id":"1420","rating":4,"review_text":"Hamlet, prince of Denmark, is studying abroad and returns to Denmark when his father dies. He is in mourning and despise the fact that his mother, the queen, has married Claudius, his uncle, now the new king of Denmark. The ghost of his father appears and tells him that Claudius has murdered him for the crown and the queen. Hamlet wants revenge and decides to do it in a spectacular way. \n Hamlet is an interesting, complicated character. He decides to murder his uncle, but he hesitates. Calculated revenge is a difficult decision to carry out. Unfortunately, the women don't get much attention. Ophelia's character remains blurry and she could have been portrayed more carefully. The same goes for the queen, Gertrude, who married shortly after her husband died. It would have been interesting to know her feelings and thoughts. These women are complicated and fascinating, and they really deserve to be complete characters. \n This is one of Shakespeares tragedies, and very dark. Horrible deeds follow each others and lead to destruction. It is gothic in a way that resembles the 1800's literature. There are many interesting themes, such as melancholy, revenge, insanity and religion's view of suicide. It has influenced authors like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens. It is the most performed Shakespeare play, perhaps the most performed play ever. Furthermore, it is considered the world's most filmed story after Cinderella.","date":"2016-05-15"}
{"book_id":"2696","rating":5,"review_text":"I actually read this one in its original glory. Reading it in Middle English was a pretty huge undertaking, but definitely well worth it! \n The collection is an estates satire looking into all of the different roles of society in that time period. Chaucer was able to view members of the court and found himself shocked at the level of hypocrisy around him, so he began this work. \n To take a good look at each classification, he created this game within the overall story that the characters take part in. On their journey to Canterbury, the host decides that each member of the party will share two stories each. Sadly, the work was never completed. What we do have though is a hilarious view on society and the evil of hypocrisy. Some of the tales were a bit hard to get through, but overall it is a work of genius that deserves to be treasured and respected.","date":"2016-05-14"}
{"book_id":"15997","rating":4,"review_text":"This book started out as being a requirement for my Medieval Lit class. However, we were only going to be able to finish bits and pieces of books 1-6 during the semester. I soon found myself so engrossed in the story that I could not skip around. Then, I continued on until finished once I got home from college. \n The general premise of the story is molded by the creation story, but Milton brings in his own elements. The most interesting thing about it is that before he got around to having the work written, he had the ability to read the Bible in its original language. So, much of the content was influenced by pieces that are not found in English translation due to things being removed and/or changed. It is hard to say which bits are accurate and were in fact present in the Bible, but the subject matter is incredibly interesting to study. \n Without a few elements that got to me, this would have easily been a 5 star rating. While I recognize that much of the views of women vs. men fit within the time frame, I was incredibly bothered by the female gender being looked at as less intelligent and strong as their male counterparts. This is simply one of those things that I do not take well. Looking beyond that though, it is a brilliant piece. The language is out of this world incredible. Also, the difference between true, unadulterated, charitable love and the love that we mortals experience (filled with pride and self fulfillment despite best intentions) was so profound. The views of Satan, Death, and Sin were also very interesting to study. \n Overall, this is a work that I could see myself reading multiple times over without growing tired of it. There is so much to it that it needs to be revisited to get exactly what Milton is driving at. As far as audience, I would say that it takes a higher reading/comprehension level, but has very appropriate content. Since it is essentially a Bible story, it's all very tame. I would put it at junior level of high school and above for the most part. This is definitely something worth reading and studying though and would suggest it to anyone and everyone.","date":"2016-04-17"}

I'm going to go a little beyond Annie's response of \"oh yeah, well, I don't know some of her poems seem pretty neat\" to say that these poems are stunning, rhythmically, syntactically, lyrically. I don't know how much more I can say without sounding trite, just that I really admire how boldly and unapologetically she confronts these thoughts of depression and hopelessness with such effortless language that skates the line between beauty and ugly. (One and the same, maybe? Or rather, one cannot exist without the other?). It's so affirmative but at the same time there's a tenderness to her writing, too, something fluid and motherly and young. \n I read the collection rather quickly so my reaction is mostly to the effects of the language, but I definitely see myself coming back to these poems. (Poems are good for that--little packages of catharsis) (I mean, that's what I already do with Mad Girl's Love Song because it GETS ME) (Does that mean I am feeding into the college girl mentality??) \n Anyways here are some quotes I really liked: \n \"Out of ash \n I rise with my red hair \n And I eat men like air.\" \n \"I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.\" \n \"And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. \n The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.\" \n \"And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes \n Its bowls of red blooms out of sheer love of me.\" \n \"Breasts and hips a confectioner's sugar \n Of little crystals, titillating the light\" \n \"The moon is my mother.

{"book_id":"50453","rating":5,"review_text":"The key to understanding what makes Bukowski (in my opinion at least) one of the greatest writers that ever lived lies in this very book, in an often-repeated quote which reads: \n 'Genius might be the ability to say a profound thing in a simple way' \n The best art (again in my opinion at least) can evoke a certain time and a place so vividly that though you may not even have experienced it, you still live it, clearly visualise it, breathe it. For instance, there is a downtempo electronic music band called Boards of Canada, that make music that reminds me of my childhood. This is despite the fact that I first listened to Boards of Canada when I was 29. \n Similarly, when I read about Bukowski's LA, I feel I've been to those very same shady bars, those dusty racetracks and lonely motel rooms. \n It's hard to pick a favourite from this collection. I could choose between You Kissed Lily, where a marital spat takes a number of extreme turns, In and Out and Over where Bukowski takes us through the highs and lows of the writer's day and makes you feel it is a privileged life after all, the road-rage revenge fantasy of Broken Merchandise, and many more. If I was pushed into a corner, I would choose Beer at the Corner Bar, a fine piece of work that embodies the deep loneliness of the misfit, rather like Camus' The Stranger. There is a very amusing quote about Camus in a different story here, to the effect that Camus spoke of misery as if he had just finished a steak dinner and a bottle of wine i.e. with a sort of detached elegance. There is no such compromise from him here. Or ever. \n Bukowski's prose as of itself isn't particularly explosive or beautiful in that flowery way. Like Dostoyevsky though, he has the ability to sum up the nature of existence in a way that shocks you with the beauty of its simplicity. He takes aim from his subconscious to yours with a deadly accuracy. He is also the voice of every societal outcast who still stands proud because his soul and his integrity is still intact. I've never really fit in with the masses, but when I read Bukowski I don't feel particularly bad that I don't. \n Hot Water Music is a terrific collection of stories that shock, amuse, and illuminate the way for a lonely soul to find his place in the world.","date":"2016-10-28"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"This book made me feel deeply connected to it and gave some really sage advice -- I also think this is a very important book, that even if you don't agree with the version of feminism and the female experience it portrays, it does a great job of capturing a certain mindset in young girls today. I really enjoyed reading it and it really gave me a feeling of warmth and understanding at the end. \n The thing I take off a star for is that, while Kaur is definitely a good writer, there was a sort of \"cheesiness\" to her style that I just couldn't get past. In my personal preferences at least I lean towards poetry that's more vernacular and natural and Kaur's writing was sometimes full of such...John Green-isms that it kind of made me roll my eyes. Not necessarily that it should have been franker and wittier, but I would have enjoyed it more if it leaned towards authenticity. \n I also totally agree with the criticisms that sometimes the poems feel like randomly selected words with line breaks, and Kaur sort of beats the whole \"you don't need a man, you want a man\" thing into the ground. Milk and Honey definitely could have been edited down and its message of empowerment would have been more powerful if it had come in a more direct way. Sometimes the little two-line poems felt unnecessary, but I appreciate that she was taking a risk with style and sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. Such is life. \n Is it good poetry? Not really. Does it evoke an emotional response in me, a sixteen year old female reader? Yes. I was torn between three and four stars because Milk and Honey is...well, not actually a very good book, but it is one that made me think about both about poetry and about personal issues. As someone who writes poetry and who emulates writers like Billy Collins, it would have been easy for me to laugh this book off because I didn't agree with its style. But it is powerful, it is new, and I liked it. I didn't like it because it was a particularly good book, but I liked it.","date":"2017-01-23"}

It is also a story of longing--of Woodson's longing to write ANYTHING, from graffiti to the stapled, self-made books of childhood. But mostly it is the story of the triumph of little Jackie Woodson going from sitting on the back of the bus with her family to one of the foremost prose writers of our time.

The Iliad is typically described as one of the greatest war stories of all time (even a kind of war protest poem showing the terrible effects of violent force), but to limit the Iliad to a war story does not begin to describe the emotional sweep of its action and characters: the heroic but wrathful Achilles, beautiful Helen, noble Hector, a pantheon of scheming Greek gods, and other heroes of Greek myth and history in the tenth and final year of the Greek siege of Troy (ca. 1200 BC).","date":"2016-08-20"}

That is probably why I didn't feel much while reading the first three parts of this collection of poems. In a way, \n my inexperience has both helped me and hindered me. \n I am hindered in my inability to relate to Kaur's experiences but at the same time my inexperience helped me better evaluate the writing since my judgement was not clouded - over eager and excited to know someone felt the way I felt. To know I wasn't alone. The absence of such emotions enabled me to better evaluate how well Kaur conveyed her experiences. \n I thought the writing was a bit plain. At this point in my reading life, I don't expect to hear anything novel. \n I consider something well written when the author is able to see the same thing everyone else is looking at from a different angle or say what someone's already said in a new way. \n Maybe in a way I'm able to relate to better than the first way I heard the same thing said. To me Kaur doesn't really do any of that. \n Initially, I said that two stars doesn't mean I don't like this. I thoroughly enjoyed the final part in this collection of poems - \"healing\". There are so many poems in that section that I want to save and carry with me forever. No doubt, part of the reason (maybe even the main reason) I enjoyed it, is because its application is broader than the other poems - not so constrained to romantic relationships/experiences. \n I think I could have given this a solid three stars if I liked at least half the poems in this collection. Unfortunately, very few poems stood out to me. For the most part I didn't think much was noteworthy about Kaur's writing. Nothing new was brought to my attention. Nor was anything old stated in a new way. \n I think the reason this is such a success is because it is #relateable. \n And because often when feeling highs of elation or lows of distress, it is hard to qualify how we feel - to put it into words so others can understand. And this is something I thought Kaur did very well. I'm sure this was the perfect read for many at the perfect time. But for me in my state of inexperience, the major selling point of this collection (its relate-ability) was lost on me. \n Perhaps, I'll pick this up again in a of couple years. \n I Think You Should Leave this Review Knowing: \n The healing section really appealed to me and made me want to purchase this just so I could read the few poems I really liked over and over again whenever I need them. \n And even though Milk and Honey wasn't perfect for me, this might be exactly what you need right now.","date":"2016-06-21"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"When I read Rupi Kaur's collection, Milk and Honey, I mourn the gradual de-evolution of rhythm and rhyme at the hands of poets in my generation. Expression trumping form. \n Don't get me wrong. I'm all for fresh voice creating a language to reflect the changing currents of our societies. That's how verse has progressed. For that level of power today, I look to Warsan Shire, Saeed Jones, Claudia Rankine, Louise Gluck. Even Lin-Manuel Miranda. \n Rupi Kaur doesn't make that list for me. The \"poems of survival\" that comprise this slim volume don't say anything revolutionary. What was designed to be evocative came off aiming for shock value, but actually achieved basic relationship advice you'd get from an aunt or college roommate, packaged in fragments and (purposefully) mispunctuated sentences. Or else quotes you'd read on Tumblr by teenagers with angst issues. Not a wonder, since Kaur made her start, and developed a fawning base, on social media sites. \n Honestly, I don't have a problem with Kaur's expression. To each their own. I simply feel that at 21-years-old at the time of writing, she lacked the emotional depth and authentic life experiences required to expound on sexuality, invasion, and honest to goodness desire.","date":"2017-06-23"}

When that segued into her section on mutual adult relationships (The Loving) it was just disturbing and ill placed. I almost stopped listening at that point, however from hearing so many raves, I continued on and listened to the second half (The Breaking and The Healing) which had many redeeming lines but was still overzealous at times and she throws in a lot of cheap metaphors in which made me question how genuine she is in her writing.

The poems are all very off the wall, some are slightly disturbing, and most are darkly humorous.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"Rupi Kaur is often referred to as an \"instapoet\" for the traction she receives from posting her poetry online. \"Milk and Honey\", is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. Kaur writes in lower case, in an even and balanced structure creating harmony juxtaposed with the hardship of the experience she describes. Her style is not dissimilar to that of American poet Tyler Knott Gregson, but with additional spacing, or pauses between the text. \n Each of these four chapters serves a different purpose. Having laid a foundation of abuse and healing, her poems inspirationally redeem themselves through her focus upon love and self love. Transporting herself from a position of not belonging, or being disenfranchised, as it were, toward a resting place where she belongs. A position where she is in touch with her inner being. \n \"\"how is it so easy for you \n to be kind to people he asked \n milk and honey dripped \n from my lips as i answered \n cause people have not \n been kind to me\" \n Every poem is extremely personal, tender and exquisite in its own way. Kaur write verses, prose, and poetry. Her aim is to explore and in turn capture the emotions we experience through hurting, loving, breaking down, falling apart and ultimatley healing. \n Whether she achieves her aim is ultimately subjective. However taking into consideration the breadth of her audience, one must conclude her poetry resonates and reverberates within the heart of soul of the masses. At the very least, she is a contemporary poet who belongs.","date":"2017-03-16"}

{"book_id":"1420","rating":5,"review_text":"Another book I finally got to read and analyse for my english literature course, and what an amazing surprise. I've always found Shakespeare boring and sentimental but this time having taken my time in reading this amazing tragedy I was able to enjoy it fully. \n Since it's a classic the story should be known to everybody so I'll be brief in my summery. Prince Hamlet just got back from Germany to assist at his father's funeral, while his mother Gertrude has already remerried. The Queen has wed the Hamlet's uncle Claudius the dead King's brother. To Hamlet this is a \"foul incest\" and already he suspect that some \"foul play\" is behind the death of his father. One night his father ghost visits the castle and Hamlet's suspicions are confirmed. His Uncle poisoned King Hamlet in his sleep, and now young Hamlet must revenge him. From this moment on Hamlet's soul will be divided on how to revenge his father and \"taint not thy mind\". \n This is the starting point for the tragedy, I loved how the play starts right of in darkness and ends in it there is no salvation the whole state of Denmark is rotten. Even the pure Hamlet is in the end corrupted by the society he lives in. It might be a play more than 400 years old but it still bring modern theme as alienation, relativism and life struggle. We might not have to face a murderous uncle but we are put everyday in front of hard decisions, we might struggle to choose and in the end we to has Hamlet have to make a compromise with the society we live in. \n If from one side this play reflects upon how little and insignificant a life is to the other side it makes u look at how big and full of possibilities the universe is, how everything is relative and our way of thinking and looking at things makes them what they are . \n -\"I could be bonded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space\"- \n It's a wonderful, modern play and having read a few others Shakespeare's play I can say that this is my favorite above all. \n I also felt like it was necessary to see it play out and I found a stunning performance at the National Theater Live by Benedict Cumberbatch, that deserve a look. My eyes were in love with the costumes, the scenery and Benedict. \n 5/5 STARS \n BLOG REVIEW + NATIONAL THEATER LIVE BY BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH PERFORMANCE \n https://bookscrumbles.blogspot.it/201...","date":"2017-01-16"}

I genuinely believe I will never read anything worse than this. \n I can't comment much on the subject matter, it's partly about abuse and violence so I can't relate to it. It's very disturbing and vulgar in how it's written. I feel like just because it's written in such a raw blunt way people will say that it's \"good\" or \"brave but I'm sorry it is just shit. \n Putting six words on a blank page is not poetry. For example: \n \"My tongue is sour from the hunger of missing you\" \n \"How can I write if he took my hands with him\" \n \"The goddess between your legs makes mouths water\" \n Also using one line and long gaps between words is not \"deep\" or \"edgey\" for example; \n \"on days \n like this \n I need you to \n run your fingers \n through my hair \n and speak softly\" \n This writing style made it incredibly difficult to tell what was a poem and what was being continued from the page before which also would only have about 8 words. \n Don't even get me started on the punctuation and difficulty of understanding things because of this. \n This book starts off about violence and abuse then turns into relationships where the author seems to write a lot about bitter love and the man/men still missing her even when their with someone new. It comes off as really arrogant and bitter. \n I feel like only people who don't actually read books would give this a good review, their probably proud of the fact that they actually finished a book. As harsh as that's sounds I have no understanding of why anyone at all would like this. Just my opinion. \n I have a particular hatred for Tumbler, Instagram, Snapchat and Pinterest.

Yeah, but it's still more than that. \n It's mainly about honoring your children and honoring your parents. It's not as twisted as some of the other Greek plays, but it is pretty horrific. Agamemnon kills his daughter, his wife kills him. Her son kills her. But wait! Apollo sanctions his killing. Alas, the Furies do not. So now we have the older gods versus the new. Parents and children at each other's throats again. \n Totally beautiful. \n And here we all thought that Zeus only caused chaos, too!

While the ancient Greek customs as depicted in the book and underlying the entire epic are foreign to me, I cannot help but be stuck by the idea of kleos apthiton. The idea that every time we read (or recite) the Iliad, we are evoking the glories of heroes (in this case Achilles) is extremely powerful. It is like that well-known saying in my culture: people die but their names don't. \n Despite the vast cultural differences in space and time, this book is a must-read, especially for people who grew up in an Asian culture like me. Literature is the best way to bridge cultural differences, and the Iliad is important for all of us because it teaches us important lessons about life, death and humanity.","date":"2017-04-11"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"Rating: 3.70 Stars \n I love poetry! I first fell in love with Lang Leav's Love & Misadventure, but re-reading them a year after its hype, I found the writing style too mainstream and mediocre. Then, back in 2014, a friend of mine suggested another poetry book \";\" by xq. I know it's a weird title but its got me hooked just by the first 2 pieces. I love it because of its sensuality and the love portrayed in each words used. \n Milk and Honey, in similarity, deals with sensuality but not as much as \";\". And to be honest, I love that difference between them, it gives each book a voice of its own. \n The way I see this book, it's like a process that a person goes through in a relationship. In raw, it tells how a person is treated in an abusive relationship or when he/she is taken for granted. The pieces weren't written long to convey the story, pieces were concise and direct to the point, but it vividly gives the image to the reader. \n Probably the most important part of this book was the \"The Healing\". It empowers the reader to be the person he/she wants to be despite what standards or other people say. It encourages the reader to embrace beauty in its rawest form, it abolishes what is seen or known to be ugly that society has taught us.","date":"2016-08-21"}

The pain of seeing through to something you can never quite touch. \n Melancholic exploration of romance and broken-off ties, Leav's poetry is both a nice-but-less of a poetry cluster of feelings, deprivations, remarkable similes. I am so confused while reviewing her work because I liked it overall but there was a certain incompleteness in her verses. The verses were designed with elegance and simplicity but may be I am not able to digest it as such an easy read. Some of her poems left me like \"Ah! What is this? A feel back towards the Lower Primary schooling. Better I had read this then.\" \n Yet, three stars means it has some bright sides too. \n 1. It made me stop shuffling the pages at times and my subconscious declared: Tehreem ponder! \n 2. The feelings and their expression! \n 3. Flawless and worthily similes! \n Love and Misadventures' real genre i.e. Poetry inspired me much less than her fiction work (other than poetry)!

{"book_id":"171547","rating":4,"review_text":"From time to time, I like to please myself with the fact that I was born on the same day as William Blake did, 4 centuries ago. \n My Favorite poet of the Romatic Age, possibly because he was at the fringe of the shifting point of Age of Reason to Romanticism, and I could crearly see its manifestations in the poems. I think that makes the poems more profound. \n Also, I liked this collection of poems not so much for the themes and the language but for the juxtoposition and the curatory work that he did (possibly because he was not only a poet but also a painter, printmaker and looked at Form from many perspectives.) I liked the contradiction of the songs of Innocence and of Experience. Naturally, my favorites were that of the Experience. Themes, characters were floating around, reappearing in different poems, that was quite modern techniqe and I liked it.","date":"2017-09-20"}

{"book_id":"6656","rating":3,"review_text":"I don't feel especially qualified to review this, so I'm just going to share my inadequate personal impressions. \n This is one of those classics it pays to do a little research on before you buckle down and commit to it. I always wondered why the word \"Comedy\" was in the title, but it does make sense when one realizes it's a reference to the structure and not to any modern conceptions of humor. This immensely complex epic poem blends together concepts and visualizations from Catholicism and Roman mythology--the later element coming as a bit of a surprise to this reader. \n The book is written in first person and divided into three, as we follow the author's vision-like guided tour through the afterlife destinations of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. Inferno felt the most compelling of the three--thanks in part to the vivid descriptions and increasing tension Dante conveyed. (Purgatorio and Paradiso got a little tedious after a while, but that could just be me.) \n I enjoyed the poetic cadence far more than the theological and political incorporation. Those with better understanding of the historical context and/or interest in the medieval worldview would undoubtedly be able to appreciate this work better than this reader happened to be able to.","date":"2016-03-08"}

I don't regret it one bit. \n Kaur's words deal with love, loss, and femininity, detailing her triumphs and her pain. Her collection is a quick read (because the poems are short), and her drawings, which are paired with her poems, create an intensely personal feeling, like the reader has been given a peek into her diary, her thoughts, her mind. \n By the end, the very short nature of all the poems does grow a bit repetitive; I would have loved to see a few longer ones to break up the super-fast pacing.

Two stars for the subject because the war in heaven can go poo on itself, I dislike all patriarchal obedience.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"I first encountered this collection on Tumblr, so it probably wouldn't be fair of me to act all surprised and claim it was too tumblr. (It was.) Some of the poems resonated with me, most were pretty underwhelming. But don't let this discourage you from reading it - apart from some repetitive themes and fragments that read like photo captions of mainstream feminist instagram accounts, the whole book has a nice calming undertone. I guess I was just expecting something different. \n The first poem from milk & honey I've read hit me pretty hard - it's been on my mind since like, September - and while the rest of the book wasn't so electric, this one kind of makes up for it. \n \"i do not want to have you \n to fill the empty parts of me \n i want to be full on my own \n i want to be so complete \n i could light a whole city \n and then \n i want to have you \n cause the two of us combined \n could set it on fire\"","date":"2016-12-30"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"For the full review, please visit paytonsbookthoughts.wordpress.com \n Lately, I've been enjoying reading poetry so much! Luckily it's also been keeping me on track with my Goodreads challenge, since they are so quick to read! \n Most poetry books are such amazing reads. The only reason I gave this one 4 stars was because it didn't speak to me on a deeper level nor was it awe inducing. I did REALLY, REALLY enjoy this book though don't get me wrong. This book has also been very popular lately. Everywhere you look it seems to be there, which is so awesome for the poetry genre! It needs more attention! \n This book is split into the hurting, the loving, the breaking, and the healing. So I want to share some of my favorite sections or poems from each part! \n The Hurting \n \"the therapist places \n the doll in front of you \n it is the size of girls \n your uncles like touching \n point to where his hands were \n you point to the spot \n between its legs the one \n he fingered out of you \n like a confession\" \n This is the first poem that broke my heart in this collection! \n \"every time you \n tell your daughter \n you yell at her \n out of love \n you teach her to confuse \n anger with kindness \n which seems like a good idea \n till she grows up to \n trust men who hurt her \n cause they look so much \n like you \n - to fathers with daughters\" \n \"a daughter should \n not have to \n beg her father \n for a relationship\" \n The truth in these poems is astounding! I just had to share it. \n The Loving \n \"sometimes though \n love will hurt you but \n love will never mean to \n love will play no games \n cause love knows life \n has been hard enough already\" \n That's the only poem that meant anything to me in this section, which I find kind of sad since its the loving section of the book. \n The Breaking \n \"dont mistake \n salt for sugar \n if he wants to \n be with you \n he will \n it's that simple\" \n \"i didn't leave because \n i stopped loving you \n i left because the longer \n i stayed the less \n i loved myself\" \n \"when you are broken \n and he has left you \n do not question \n whether you were \n enough \n the problem was \n you were so enough \n he was not able to carry it\" \n \"you treat them like they \n have a heart like yours \n but not everyone can be as \n soft and as tender \n you don't see the \n person they are \n you see the person \n they have the potential to be \n you give and give till \n they pull everything out of you \n and leave you empty\" \n GIRL, YAS! Yes, Yes, Yes. Go figure this section was the most relatable to me. I'm not surprised, but everything in the section was so true. Favorite section of the book. Hands down. This section is the reason I will recommend this book to people! \n The Healing \n \"who tricked you \n into believing \n another person \n was meant to complete you \n when they most they can do is complement\" \n Unfortunately that's the only poem I highlighted in this section. This also doesn't surprise me because I, myself, have not completely healed so how I am supposed to connect with anything in this section. Which has absolutely nothing to do with Rupi or her book. However, the one thing I have learned in my healing process is that my partner shouldn't complete me, but complement me instead! \n This really is a great read and I really enjoyed reading it. I'm sure so many people can relate and connect with at least one section in this collection!","date":"2017-03-04"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"Milk and Honey is an incredible collection of poetry that doesn't seek to soothe the discomfort of the reader, it seeks to shout the feelings of the poet and that is exactly what I'm looking for in such a personal and poignant prose. The book is divided into 4 sections: the hurting, the loving, the breaking and the healing. It takes the author's journey from a really traumatic abusive childhood to finding the love of a good man, to the deterioration of that love and then finally the new dawn of self-discovery. \n I absolutely loved this, originally renting it as an ebook from the library I quickly realized I needed a physical copy because I needed to highlight the shit out of this. \n This half of the year has been about me re-discovering my love for poetry collections, how they speak to me in their small ways and how I keep their words locked in my heart, stroking them every once in a while. \n I highly suggest you check it out, there's certain passages like: \n \"he guts her \n with his fingers \n like he's scraping \n the inside of a \n cantaloupe clean\" \n ... that are so raw and I love raw in my poetry, it really live for it. \n Then there's lovely ones that would be loved by bridal prospects: \n \"you might not have been my first love \n but you were the love that made \n all the other loves \n irrelevant\" \n So in all, I think there's plenty for everyone to enjoy, to internalize and to perhaps memorize. There's a good reason this collection has gotten such hype, it's utterly beautiful. \n \"don't tell me my women \n aren't as beautiful \n as the ones in \n your country \n our backs \n tell stories \n no books have \n the spine to \n carry\"","date":"2016-08-19"}

{"book_id":"1715","rating":1,"review_text":"Oh how sad this book made me! I wanted to love this book because I love history and mythology. I knew all these stories but had never heard of a collection of all of them before Ovid's Metamorphoses. When it turned out to be one of the few Roman novels still around, I knew I had to read it. Starting the epic, I was very excited but rapidly became disenchanted. Personally, I dislike that with so many characters and events that happen in each of the 15 books that there were no subtitles or notice of a change in the stories. It made the overview in the beginning of each book pointless because I'd always forget what story I was reading. The change from one story to the next, while staying in the epic style, ended up confusing me. I constantly had to reread sections because I was not sure if I had missed anything. The stories that held my attention the most were in Volume II, but I still didn't enjoy reading this epic as much as I have others. There were stories I really liked but I had already read them from Greek Mythology or found them elsewhere. My frustration grew so much that I had to write myself helpful description notes on the side in a completely different copy of the book.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"I'd seen a lot of Rupi Kaur's work on Pinterest and other such sites and really liked the poems. I think reading them all in one sitting is a bit much because some are more abstract than others. I also felt that I could relate to some poems more than others. Some poems, in my opinion, were a little cliche and the structure is somewhat different to the type of poetry I like to read - but who am I to say how one should express themselves? I actually felt very inspired when I finished this book because, as someone who would like to write a book one day, Milk and Honey reaffirms that you can create art from pain and that, yes writing is therapeutic but is also a painful process in which you relive what has hurt you and expose yourself to opinion and critique. \n I have to say, I did feel a little annoyed at some points throughout this book because I felt that the message was somewhat contradictory. For example, one poem reads along the lines of, \"if you are not enough for yourself you will never be enough for someone else\" and \"you must want to spend the rest of your life with yourself first\" (pp. 197-8) but then another poem says, \"nothing even matters except love and human connection who you loved and how deeply you loved them\" (p. 194). To me, this goes against the whole 'love yourself and your solitude' notion that I think Milk and Honey intended. Saying that you are a complete person on your own and then saying that the only thing that really matters at the end of the day is who you love and how much you loved them is, to me, very contradictory. \n Visually, this book is beautiful - the cover is simple and stunning and the accompanying artwork that fills the pages is amazing, though it did seem a bit structured in the sense that every page looked the same (left page contained only writing, while right page had writing and an image). The only other thing that I didn't like was the lack of punctuation and capitalisation, but that's probably just my own OCD when it comes to grammar. \n Overall, I didn't love this book but I liked it. I think it is a nice book to have in a collection and I would read more of Rupi's work.","date":"2016-05-26"}

I had a gal named stella with me and the writer on the bench said that he had read a passage stating that I was the one ( the woman with a stella). I also thought he was handsome but I didn't want to get too carried away. I simply said, \" Well, you're very handsome and I'm sure you have no problem finding women.\" I was secretly poking fun at his attempt to lure me in and also doubting the probability that a relationship between the two of us would ever come to fruition. Besides, he was dating someone, I had found out. Yes, dating someone and engaging in what I would call an \"open search.\" This is a habit employed by many males where they will keep their current lover and proceed to search for other candidates. I wouldn't say it's the right way and I wouldn't say it's the wrong way. Now, before we parted ways, the man gave me this book and I went along home. I am in the habit of reading and did indeed read the gift. It's amazing! I shall return to it in times of despair for I am reminded of this truism \" love, love, love, that is the soul to genius.\" I am further reminded that difficulty and solitude is a blessing.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"UPDATE: (15/8/17) Lowering my rating by a star. \n Now, I posted my goodreads review of this book on the very day I finished it. Reflecting back after six months, I think it was my heart that decided to hand this book a 4-star rating then. The poems in this book did stir powerful emotions, but they were really short and now, when I try to recollect some of the poems, a surprisingly tiny number surfaces. Rupi Kaur evokes a lot of feelings and if you don't believe me, just go and hear her reading some of the poems in this book. \n Anyways, I started reading this book once again and I've noticed that the poetry is very short. Poems need to be a bit more long. Of course, Rupi manages to pack the maximum number of punches in her limited words, yet, I felt that it was a bit incomplete. All that aside, this is hella feminist and can also double as a pick-me-up when you're feeling down and out. Looking for a book that will make you feel all kinds of emotions? Look no further. Here's the perfect book for you. \n ORIGINAL REVIEW (16/01/17) : \n Beautifully heart-wrenching, 'Milk and Honey' will break you. Will heal you. Will make you realise your importance as a woman and as a girl in this society dominated by men. It will make you feel the triumph, the loss, the pain and the love that comes with joy and happiness. Each one of the four chapters will make you stronger and make you believe in yourself. It is must for any girl to read this book because it will mould you into one strong soldier of this society. And trust me. We need more such soldiers. \n Milk and Honey is nothing short of an inspirational book. The impact it had within the short 30 minutes span is simply astonishing that I, myself cannot believe how it has made me a different person with a positive outlook of life. Rupi Kaur talks about being a women, abuse, love, heart-break so poetically that her writing flows with elegance. \n I personally found myself echoing with 'The Healing' section where Kaur takes you through being a woman and also being proud if it; to embrace it and love it.Profound and impacting, this book will be your best friend and will teach you to love being yourself and tough and strong and powerful. Simply awe-inspiring.","date":"2016-09-26"}
{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"milk and honey is exactly what poetry should be; it's pain that has been grasped with both hands and meticulously melded into something beautiful. \n And what can be more beautiful than knowing you're not alone? What can be more beautiful than someone reaching out to you, taking you by the hand and whispering you that you're not alone in your heartache? The experiences and emotions Rupi Kaur writes of are universal, but are still often endured alone by an individual. milk and honey, however, shows us that we don't have to suffer in silence and shame \n Rupi addresses her readers directly through this poignant yet stunning collection of poetry. The poems, ranging from two lines to two pages, span an array of human emotion and issues. They address love, loss, trauma. abuse, healing and femininity. I found myself not just reading but consuming her simple yet hard hitting words, placing sticky notes on countless pages because I knew, in one of those moments of sorrow that inevitably strike us down in the dead of night, I would want to look back to those words and know that I'm not alone in my feelings. \n Rupi Kaur doesn't seek to trivialize the pain we have experienced and will, undoubtedly, experience again. She simply seeks to bridge the emotional gulf existing between us all, to encourage us to speak openly about our pain. Only by voicing our feelings and listening to those of others can we begin the healing process so many of us need to desperately begin. In a love letter from Rupi to us, her readers, she thanks us for making it to the end of the journey that is milk and honey, saying that she would be nowhere and nothing were it not for us. milk and honey was a personal journey for Rupi, the spilling of words onto paper acting as a form of release and healing and by reading her book, we have all aided in that healing. Isn't that something wonderful? Isn't that something we should all be able to do? To speak and be heard without fear of judgment or ridicule. \n More than half the poems encased within the simple yet striking cover of milk and honey can be classed as my favorite.

Regardless of all the pain and heartache, we are still here. We are still fighting. We are all worthy of love and happiness and no amount of suffering can diminish that.","date":"2017-04-04"}

{"book_id":"6656","rating":2,"review_text":"Maybe something is lost in translation, or more likely the greatness of this work has dimmed as we've moved away from so many of the ideologies this take on hell, purgatory, and heaven is founded on, but to be honest this was a pretty dull read. I couldn't shake the thought that this is essentially medieval fanfiction, Dante is just imagining the afterlife and writing about where famous folks might end up within his tiered framework. I bet about 700 years ago that was cutting edge, but I can't muster much enthusiasm for such an outdated thought experiment. \n If you are looking to understand 14th century belief systems, this is the book for you.

While the subject matter sounds interesting (war, murder, trial by the gods, etc), almost all action takes place off-stage, and the vast majority of time is spent with undeveloped characters (and usually *groups* of people as one voice, which I know is common in plays of this era but is still really weird when you think about it) essentially reciting plot points and referencing history.","date":"2017-02-10"}
{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"read my complete review here: http://isabellsbooks.blogspot.de/ \n MY THOUGHTS ON IT \n It is very tempting \n to write my thoughts down \n like this aswell \n now \n but I guess \n I won't do it \n I have never really been into reading poetry but have always found it interesting to write my own. \n There is a huge hype surrounding this book that makes it hard for the poems to live up to. \n The book is separated into four parts: \n The hurting. \n The loving. \n The breaking. \n The healing. \n I enjoyed the whole dark layout of this book. The four parts are separated by black pages which give the whole book a clear black-white contrast and stress the focus of the words. \n I liked \"the hurting\" and \"the healing\" part best. \"the loving\" and \"the breaking\" parts focussed way too much on boy-girl relationship issues and that wasn't what I was looking for in this book. I could understand why \"the breaking\" part, which focussed on the heartbreak, was the biggest one, since one always seems to have the most need to write something down in that time, but I would have loved for \"the hurting\" and \"the healing\" parts to be bigger and for them to take up more space of this book. \n \"The hurting\" part focussed on family issues and on sexual abuse and felt raw and intense. The illustrations were daring and forced one to stare at them longer. I really liked that because that part made me feel something. Still, I would have wanted to read more poetry about those depths than about heartbreak. I enjoyed the openness and shamelessness with which the author talked about sex. \n \"The healing\" part consisted of some feminist poems, which I really liked. There were a lot of poems in this part that I immediately wanted to take a picture of and post on Instagram. They were important and very well written. \n The illustrations were often even better than the poems. I often stared at them for a while until I had the feeling that I had fully grasped them. Although I don't feel very comfortable in saying \"fully\" here, since both the poetry and the illustrations leave a lot open for interpretation. \n It's definitely a book to read at least twice. I already reread most of the poems while first reading it to let them sink in deeper. But I think that once you've seen the whole picture, after having read it all through for the first time, you will gain another perspective on the single poems and maybe read them in a different way the second time. \n Of course one will read the poems in a different way depending on when and where one reads them. If you currently are in a relationship or do suffer from heartbreak you will read it in totally different ways and it will speak to you on different levels than it will when you are not. \n There were definitely some poems that I would mark in the book if it were my own and that I would go back to every once in a while. \n Some poems \n have felt \n as if the author had just \n hit enter \n every now and then \n and called it \n poetry \n then \n But others felt much more thought through than that. And still, I would have liked longer poems better than the many two-liners that were in it. These were also why I read through this book in under an hour. And I really did take my time with it and reread most of the poems and stared a while at all the illustrations. I also would have liked it better if there had been more illustrations, since those were often better than the poems themselves. \n It wasn't as feminist as I had thought and hoped it to be but the few feminist poems that were in it were really great and worthy of being painted on a t-shirt and being worn proudly. \n Everytime I encountered an incredibly great poem I wanted more like these, wanted to get shocked, to get sucked in and to get furious again. And I had actually expected the book to make me more furious than it actually did. I think that this is also because \"the hurting\" and \"the healing\" part weren't long enough. \n I also didn't like that the author wrote so hateful about the potential \"next girl\" that would come after her and would be her exlover's new lover in \"the breaking\" part. The poems seemed so hateful against this other girl which colluded completely with the poems in \"the healing\" that preached girls loving and supporting other girls instead of hating on them. The poems in \"the healing\" part were so furious against men who undermine other women in order to make one woman feel better about herself but I couldn't take those poems too seriously because of the previous poems that did the exact same as those men. \n I would have liked more \"stomach-punching\" poems, as the author describes her own poems in one poem. \n \"milk and honey\" could have been more in my opinion but I still enjoyed it. If you go into it with neutral expectations, you will probably enjoy it a lot more. \n The book has left me more open and welcoming to poetry but also a bit sceptical to poetry books being praised as being feminist. \n To end this on a positive note though - when I took all the pictures of my favourite poems, I was surprised by how many great ones there were actually in this book after all. \n So if you don't expect this to be feminist poetry first, you can definitely take a lot out of it for yourself. \n MY RATING \n I award this book with 3,5 out of 5 stars.","date":"2017-06-25"}

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":4,"review_text":"Plot Summary: \n In this free verse memoir, Jacqueline Woodson relates her childhood experiences as a young African American girl growing up in the 1960s. Through short vignettes, Woodson provides accounts of what it was like living in the segregated South, home of her mother's parents, as well as life in New York City. Woodson also shares with readers her journey toward becoming the writer she is today. \n Critical Analysis: \n Brown Girl Dreaming is a beautifully written memoir of a young African American girl growing up in the 1960s in both the North and the South. Because this is an honest free verse novel, the characters are authentic and not stereotyped and reflect distinct cultural experiences with distinct realities during the Civil Rights Movement. The book is also culturally accurate in terms of physical characteristics, intellect, and emotional attributes. Additionally, there are instances in the story where the characters substantively and authentically interact with characters of other cultures, specifically with Maria, a Hispanic young girl, and her family. In regards to the setting, the story is set in Ohio, South Carolina, and New York in the 1960s and 1970s. Since the personal narrative is rich in cultural details, there are several cultural markers that are consistent with the historical time period and African American culture such as, accounts and references of marches, sit-in protests, Freedom Riders, President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, Ruby Bridges, and civil rights. Moreover, the short vignettes of sitting in the back of the bus due to a \"Coloreds to the Back\" sign and the burning of a high school because of the marches add to the authenticity of the story as well as accurately depict African American history. \n Because the theme is about family memories, it invites readers to reflect on their own childhood memories as well as on the similarities and differences between their families and Jacqueline's family. This first person memoir also celebrates diversity in the accounts where Jacqueline interacts with the Hispanic culture and the Jehovah's Witnesses faith. Being that I am a Hispanic woman who grew up in the Jehovah's Witnesses faith, I can attest that Woodson's portrayal of both cultures is accurately authentic. Furthermore, this personal narrative provides readers with in-depth treatment of cultural issues such as, when Jacqueline's mother tells her while sitting in the back of the bus that they are just as good as anybody else. Since this novel is written in free verse format, readers are able to quickly read each childhood memory. As for the illustrations in this book, the two family trees and black and white photographs of herself and her relatives from both sides of her family are accurate portrayals of the African American culture in regards to physical characteristics. Through these illustrations, readers are able to easily follow along with the author as she shares personal details about her life and her family. All in all, I highly recommend this coming-of-age memoir because readers are able to vicariously experience the author's childhood.","date":"2016-03-01"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"\"people go \n but how \n they left \n always stays\" \n I usually never read poetry and I think my school is responsible for that. I hated writing poem analyses because I was extremely bad at it; I just always interpreted the poems different from how my teacher interpreted them. And I was also, and still am, really bad at writing poems myself which is why every time I heard the word poem in class, I was about to just leave the room. Due to that I never really even thought about trying to just read some poems at home without having to analyze them or continue writing them in the style of the poet. \n By now, my time in school is over though and at the beginning of this year I wrote down some 'reading goals' I want to achieve this year because I want to challenge myself and want to stop always reading the same kind of books. One of the points on this list is \"read a poetry book\", so when my sister came home with a copy of 'Milk and Honey' a couple of weeks ago, I just knew that I would have to read it. \n Before I started reading 'Milk and Honey', I absolutely didn't have any idea what it was about. I didn't look up any information about it on the internet and so I just went straight into it. To be honest, I thought it would take me some time to get into this book and it wouldn't immediately made me feel something. But after the first couple of poems, I was already hooked. I wasn't touched by all the texts (poems and prose) in this book but there were a couple that really, really touched me and were quite thought-provoking. There were some poems in here that were only a few words long but still touched me so much that I had to put the book down for a couple of minutes to just think about them. \n 'Milk and Honey' is truly a great book and it deserves 4 out of 5 stars. I never thought I would actually enjoy it that much but I'm really glad my sister brought this one home with her.","date":"2017-01-30"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"Reading through the other reviews I can see a lot of people have written that this book was 'underwhelming' and I have this strong urge to defend the author, not that she needs defending because her work is 'honest' and 'real' and I think its beautiful because of it. Honestly, this is about her experiences and the trauma she has been through and how she survived. Coping is different for everyone and hers is writing. \n For me, poetry does not need to be relatable. Poetry is something the poet feels and wishes to convey. In a form he or she wants to. So what if hers is sentences separated by spaces and 'enters' . Just reading this made me feel some type of loss. A loss the author felt. Something no person should have gone through. Each word- each sentence- each page is the author trying to let the grief out of her system. Maybe it is underwhelming for some of you because you expect poetry to make you feel a certain way. Or perhaps you just cannot relate. I am not saying that poetry needs to be relatable. Because for me, poetry just needs to be honest and doused with real and raw emotions. \n It must have been difficult to reveal this part of her to the world but writing gives some sort of peace and telling people, making yourself be heard, is another way to find peace. \n All in all, Milk and Honey was too honest, too sad and I cannot be more proud of Rupi Kaur for sharing her words.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"My Reaction in a Nutshell: \n I am currently experiencing a whirlwind of emotions. \n The Long Version: \n I have never willingly read poetry before, but man does this book make me want to read more. \n I devoured this book in one sitting. And afterwords felt like crying and cheering and embracing myself and crying some more. \n My advice to people reading this: don't read it all in one sitting. This collection of poems is meant to be savored. You should read it slowly over the course of multiple days. Read a collection of one, two, or three poems in a sitting and then take a break to let your body, mind, and soul ingest the words. Each day read no more than one section in its entirety. If you read more than that you will experience a rush of emotions so strong that you won't be able to move or speak or think. \n If you only read one poetry book in your entire life, make sure it's this one. \n You will cry and laugh and feel empowered and cry some more. I started tabbing my favorite poems and then had to refrain from tabbing the entire book. Each is so thought provoking. \n Fuck. I am still not able to full comprehend what I read. That's what reading this all in one sitting will do to you. \n I loved the sketches. \n I will most likely add more to this review later. Maybe some snippets of my favorite poems. I just had to let people know that this book is a must read. \n ***TRIGGER WARNINGS: R/SA, abusive relationship","date":"2016-02-12"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"(more like 1.5 stars) \n I don't really know how I feel abut this ... underwhelmed and a little confused, maybe. \n A little disclaimer at the beginning: This poetry collection is impossible to rate because it's about Rupi's experiences, her love life, her hurting and healing. Writing those poems is what got her through a hard time and who am I to judge that? It's none of my business how she deals with break-ups and therefore my rating is based off two things: 1. the language quality of the poems and 2. the feelings the poems evoked in me (the latter being quite irrelevant because it's just my very unimportant opinion). \n With that being said, let's jump straight into the review. \n I read this poetry collection at my local bookstore in about an hour which means I havn't spend much time analyzing the poems whilst reading because a) I found them to be very straight forward (contemporary language, easy to understand, no hidden messages) and b) quite repetitive (same use of words, several poems which at their core tell the same thing). I definetly plan on re-reading this poetry collection because there were a few poems or just simple one-liners that really resonated with me and which I like to write in my little book of quotes. \n So this collection is split into 4 chapters: the hurting, the loving, the breaking and the healing. Whereas the first chapter deals a lot with Rupi's problematic relation to her dad (which resulted into her mistrust in men and sexuality/ femininity etc.) the latter three about her first love, the good, the bad, the ugly and how she managed to get over her first break up. \n I'm not a romantic person, not at all. Not one bit. I get easily annoyed by cheesy romance, I found myself rolling my eyes a lot at those poems in the \"the loving\"-chapter but let's analyze this in a chronological order. \n The Hurting \n I had a lot of problems with this. It was just a weird start to the journey Rupi planned on taking me, the reader. She blames her father a lot, how he put her mother down and embodied that men are better than woman and woman are only there for the pleasure of men. In the same breath we have a poem about a little girl who was raped by her uncle and demonstrates on a doll where he touched her in a therapeutic session. This just confused me. Is Rupi the little girl? Why are those poems there? \n The Loving \n So, Rupi falls in love, leaving her bad childhood experiences behind and finally trusting a male. She is head over heels. She loves exploring her sexual and feminine side. Good for her, awesome. I just didn't necessarily need 15 similar poems which had a strong Tumblr-feel to them. Like I could just picture my 16-year-old Tumblr-Indie-self slamming the reblog button for one of those poems without having the poem leaving any impact on me or being of importance whatsoever. The poems felt a little pretentious. But as I said before, I am not the romantic type. \n The Breaking \n Things get ugly and they split. Rupi, a known embassador for woman's rights and equality and vocal about not shaving and no period-shaming (all [to me] obvious things of course but great that she is trying to be another voice for that movement), incorporates a lot of poems about her now ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend and how this girlfriend isn't as good as she (Rupi) is and how the new girl can't satisfy her boy as much as she could in the past. Competition much? How stupid and against the belief of women supporting each other instead of putting one another down is that? Those poems were just cringe-worthy. \n The Healing \n Suddenly Rupi has the realization that all women are equal and awesome and that she is better off alone and doesn't need male appreciation to be a full woman. Along the lines of the sterotypical \"I need to love myself first before a man can love me\". Not something I needed to hear again and definitely not 15 times in a row. \n Nonetheless, there were some pretty remarkable poems in this collection which I will carry dear to my heart. My favorite (by far) goes at follows: \n \"Our backs tell stories \n no books have the spine to carry\" \n -- women of color \n As I said in the beginning I will re-read this, mark some brilliant quotes and if my thoughts change, I will let you know.","date":"2016-06-16"}

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":4,"review_text":"4.5/5 - Full review at emileereads: http://emileereads.com/blog/2017/8/19... \n When I realized Brown Girl Dreaming was written in free verse, I was immediately intrigued and knew I would either love it or hate it because of the style. Fortunately, the structure worked really well and I completely loved this book. \n The poetry made this book fly by. Additionally, it made the author's point of view as a child so much more impactful as it emphasized the important, defining moments in her life. The most sobering parts were when you see her grow up and begin to understand the Civil Rights movement while still wanting to maintain childlike innocence and play. The author clearly had pride in who she was and had a beautiful inner strength that developed over time. \n I don't really have a complaint. For anyone interested in reading it, though, I will say there wasn't necessarily a \"point\" to the story. It was just Woodson recounting her early life. This certainly isn't a bad thing, and it didn't keep me from thoroughly enjoying the book. However, if you like plot and action this might not be your thing. I'd still recommend it anyway because of the experience of reading all free verse.","date":"2017-06-22"}

{"book_id":"46199","rating":5,"review_text":"A truly inspiring collection of encouraging words for anyone who cherishes solitude in order to capture something writing. In this tiny book of letters from the poet Rainer Maria Wilke to an aspiring young writer, he tells the student that if you are a writer, you write. Because you must; you can't help it. In Rilke's his words: \n \"Find out... for yourself whether you would have to die if you were forbidden to write. This most of all: ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: Must I write? And if this answer rings out in assent, if you meet this solemn question with a simple \"I must,\" then build your life in accordance with this necessity. If, as I have said, one feels one could live without writing, then one shouldn't write at all.\" \n To me, this was clarifying, and I think these letters would encourage anyone else who is chasing \"butterflies\" -- not to pin them dead in a box, but to capture in order to share and then release.","date":"2016-10-24"}

{"book_id":"46199","rating":5,"review_text":"So short and yet so valuable. I finished it too quickly, before I even fully understood what Rilke was saying. But I know that when I read it, I read it quietly, with the reverence due to a book of scripture, held close to my heart with the thumb of one hand holding the pages open. I finished reading it in the park near Hayes Valley on a sunny afternoon and afterwards I felt compelled to walk with the book balanced on my head as if by doing so, I could let the words and the wisdom seep directly into my brain. I think I attracted more than a few side glances and one man even came up to me to ask what book was on my head. He asked me what it was about and I couldn't easily say. I said it was about life and love and how to be an artist, but that didn't feel like it captured the whole substance of the short book. As I write this now, I keep coming back to a word that Rilke used over and over again in the book: \"unsayable\". It's a beautiful word, one that I haven't seen used in any other context that I can remember, and one I think that comes closest to describing what I felt when I read it. That is to say that I can't describe it; that the experience itself was unsayable for me. I've already started re-reading it; perhaps I'll have more to say after a second or third reading. Or perhaps I'll just leave it as an experience for each of us to discover on our own, in the midst of our own deep and personal solitude.","date":"2016-12-09"}

Everything he says, we only just begin to hear it now. He's a freaking visionary. \n Some beautiful quotes : \n \"I hold this to be the highest task of a bond between two people: that each should stand guard over the solitude of the other.\" \n \"Have patience with everything that remains unsolved in your heart. Try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books written in a foreign language. Do not now look for the answers. They cannot now be given to you because you could not live them. It is a question of experiencing everything. At present you need to live the question. Perhaps you will gradually, without even noticing it, find yourself experiencing the answer, some distant day.\" \n \"The point of marriage is not to create a quick commonality by tearing down all boundaries; on the contrary, a good marriage is one in which each partner appoints the other to be the guardian of his solitude, and thus they show each other the greatest possible trust. A merging of two people is an impossibility, and where it seems to exist, it is a hemming-in, a mutual consent that robs one party or both parties of their fullest freedom and development. But once the realization is accepted that even between the closest people infinite distances exist, a marvelous living side-by-side can grow up for them, if they succeed in loving the expanse between them, which gives them the possibility of always seeing each other as a whole and before an immense sky.\"","date":"2016-11-28"}

{"book_id":"91571","rating":4,"review_text":"I usually do a bit of research before reading one of Shakespeare's plays. Y'know, read over a brief summary and go through the characters and stuff. Measure for Measure being the last play in my intense catch-up effort I decided to skip all usual preamble and just go in blind. And I absolutely adored it. Measure for Measure is one of my ultimate favourite plays of this challenge. Claudio is arrested for getting a prostitute pregnant and is sentenced to be executed. Meanwhile, the Duke has left town (but in reality he has just disguised himself as a Friar in order to spy on his own people) and the evil Angelo is put in charge of the town. Meanwhile, Claudio's sister Isabella goes to Angelo to beg of him not to execute her brother. Angelo hesitates but comes up with a deal, if Isabella gives him her virginity he won't execute Claudio. BAM. This play is fucking brilliant. \n Measure for Measure balances on the threshold of tragedy and comedy. One scene may have the brilliantly evil Angelo doing something brilliantly evil and the next scene may contain a barrage of Pompey's utterly hilarious one-liners. This is just such a perfect play. I have no idea why this is one of Shakespeare's least popular works. We get 1,001 different film versions of Romeo and Juliet every year but yet there is still to be a major production of Measure for Measure. I cannot praise this play any higher, it's an utter masterpiece.","date":"2016-07-28"}

{"book_id":"27822","rating":5,"review_text":"My first encounter with Onegin was in the form of Tchaikovsky's famous opera at the Royal Opera House in London, years ago. It was one of my first ever operas and I was enraptured, both by the singers' abilities and by the story which moved from comedy to tragedy and everything in between. What remained in my memory of the story, however, was the immensity of the story, its epic feel despite its straightforward story. So of course I wanted to jump into Pushkin's beautiful novel-in-verse the first chance I got! Thanks to Pushkin Press and Netgalley for providing me with a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review. \n Written in the early 1800s, (1823-32 to be precise), Yevgeny Onegin is often considered Alexander Pushkin's finest work. He himself is considered by many to be one of the most important authors and figures in Russian cultural history. As Briggs puts it in his Introduction: 'He is to Russia what Dante is to Italy, Shakespeare to England and Cervantes to Spain'. Onegin is a masterpiece of intricate complexity. Rhymes seem to come naturally, flowing as simply and melodically as can be, yet a closer look reveals the skill hidden artfully behind the words. Everyone who has read a beautiful poem has felt inspired to pick up poetry themselves, and has subsequently discovered the difficulty of producing such beauty themselves. Reading Pushkin's Onegin is a beautiful spectacle, which only Pushkin himself could have orchestrated. \n The story of Yevgeny Onegin is both frivolous and tragic, sad and uplifting, revelatory and mysterious. Pushkin combines the qualities of both genres he engages in: prose and verse. Onegin is a novel in its structure and content, a story of passion and death, but flows as beautifully and musically as a poem. As such it shouldn't come as a surprise that Onegin has proven a challenge to translate. English has an advantage, when it comes to translating Onegin, since it is written in the sonnet form which works so well in English. But it has to be said that this novel in verse is uplifted by its translation. A.D.P. Briggs, one of the mot noted Pushkin scholars, not only writes a fascinating introduction to his work, his translation is beautiful. At times I forgot that I was reading Onegin in translation, so clearly did I feel and understand Pushkin's intentions and humour. I was so impressed by his translation I am currently actively searching for his other translations of Russian works. \n Yevgeny Onegin has become one of my favourite foreign works. Russian literature has been shaped by Pushkin and his Onegin and after reading it for myself I can see how far their influence has reached. To fans of both prose and of Russian literature I can only say: get yourself a copy, as soon as possible. \n Link for full review: http://universeinwords.blogspot.com/2...","date":"2016-11-22"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"Blog post: http://sonichreads.tumblr.com/post/16... \n Review: I had known that this book was the beloved book of people and it was really popular. Personally, I was so intrigued in tumblr poetry for so long that I began writing one myself. Now, not so much. So basically, I knew what I was getting into when I picked this book up. \n 'he only whispers i love you \n as he slips his hands \n down the waistband \n of your pants \n this is where you must \n understand the difference \n between want and need \n you may want that boy \n but you certainly \n don't need him' \n milk and honey is a collection of poetry about love, loss, trauma, abuse, and femininity. There were many many many short ones that were unable to tell a story and obviously wasn't worth my money. I truly did not feel anything, anything reading this book. This book contains a lot of sentences being separated by enters, which really wasn't necessary because you could have just write it in a sentence and that would have been more provokable. There were also paragraphs where sentences were being divided by full stops, which were also not necessary, in my opinion. To me, if I am to describe this book in one word, it will be pretentious. Pretentious and not provoking. I've also read some tumblr poetry that are pretentious, but I figured them to be good ones. \n All the lousiness aside, if this is the way a person tells her story, fine. Some pages can be considered powerful due to the commitment and the confidence of a writer. I didn't essentially need a week to read this book. This book can be normally finished in an evening or a morning because it's really short. I thought that the drawings/illustrations in every page felt really personal and tumblr-ish. (I mean, of course, because it's tumblr. Everyone shares their personal stuff on it.) \n Overall: This book was a really quick read. Each page was being ornamented by drawings/scribbles. I wouldn't say that it was a proper or amazing way to represent poetry nor recommend it to anyone.","date":"2016-09-30"}
{"book_id":"18003300","rating":3,"review_text":"Blog post: http://sonichreads.tumblr.com/post/16... \n Review: I have read quite a few poetry before, especially on tumblr. But let's just say time passes and people change, so I no longer am obsessed with tumblr-styled poetry. Don't get me wrong, I like some of them, others I don't care for, and I'm not addictively reading them like I was when I was a 15-year-old heartbroken crybaby. People change. \n This book was my third poetry book after milk and honey, which I enjoyed but did not love, and I Wrote This for You: Just the Words, which hit home and helped me see other types of love. I wanted to pick this book up for a long time now yet how the bookstore in Cambodia priced this book turned me off. So, a bookstore website sold this book for $6 and I bought it. It's a great deal. This book was a really short one and I both liked and disliked what are in it. \n Love & Misadventure is a book of love poems and paragraphs, where one is grieving and praising a boy she can't live without. I mean, it's called Love & Misadventure, what was I expecting? Alright, I'd have to say I was honestly so surprised when I heard that the author is Cambodian because this wasn't anything I was expecting, but needless say that I will be forever harsh on books regardless of who the author is. \n Already like two pages into the book, I blurbed 'what the fuck'. I am so sorry. I read the lines a couple of times before settling in. There were few that I think I misinterpreted/misunderstood completely because of how 'deep' or should I say ridiculous it sounds, like this one for example: \n \"Xs and Os \n Love is a game \n of tic-tac-toe, \n constantly waiting, \n for the next x or o.\" \n When I first flipped through the pages of this book, I was so annoyed at home pretentious it is and of course, I feel sorry for the dead trees. This book leaves a lot of unnecessary white spaces considering some poems are about four lines and each line consists of three words. But I continued on because who wants to waste their money? \n Beside the not-so-good review, there are some that I enjoyed and it really did provoke my inner 15-year-old self, who cried to the lyrics of Taylor Swift songs and would have loved this book far more than I do. \n \"A Question \n It was a question I had worn on my lips for days--like a loose thread on my favorite sweater I couldn't resist pulling--despite knowing it could all un ravel around me. \n \"Do you love me?\" I ask. \n In your hesitation, I found my answer.\" \n \"Time Travelers \n In all our wrongs, \n I want to write him, \n in a time where \n I can find him. \n Before the tears \n that tore us. \n When our history was \n before us.\" \n \"That Day \n I remember our highs in hues \n like the color of his eyes \n as the sun was setting; \n the pale of his hands in mine, \n and the blue of his smile. \n I remember our sorrow in the shades, \n like the gray of the shadows, \n which loomed that day, \n and the white in his lie \n when he promised to stay.\" \n Overall: I guess that's all the thoughts I can collect. Some of the poems I enjoyed, some I didn't. Although this book might be leaned to the younger side of audience because of the love is introduced in this book.","date":"2016-08-08"}
{"book_id":"1420","rating":4,"review_text":"SPOILER ALERT: This analysis of Hamlet is written for those who are already familiar with the play in its entirety or don't mind me giving away the ending. \n I have been trying to read Hamlet for quite some time, but was unable to \"get into\" the story. So, I forced myself. I'd heard it was the greatest play ever written and felt I should know more than the image of some guy holding a skull, saying \"To be or not to be.\" Which didn't happen in the play. The skull came later. \n A major issue is that I'm not one of those who can read Shakespeare as though it is my second language. I struggle. So, I admit I bought the No Fear Shakespeare version that has the original play on the left and the modern translation on the right. I could not have understood the plot without it. \n Alright, so what do I think? Sigh. My first thought went to Old Hamlet's ghost. \"Are you happy now?\" I wanted to ask him. \"Is this what you'd hoped would happen?\" It seems the death of his widow and heir along with his brother/murderer was, so to speak, overkill. \n And what of Young Hamlet? He was hurt and angry by his mother's remarriage to his Uncle Claudius, but the revenge his father's ghost required seemed more an unwelcome burden than an undying passion. (More death words, reflecting the major theme) He basically knew he was charged to kill his uncle, but found myriad ways to avoid the actual act. \n That's when I realized. This is a parody of the popular genre of the day, the revenge tragedy. Not in the sense of making a mockery of it, per se. To me, it explores the shallowness of the stereotypical drama. Shakespeare himself must have been, like Hamlet, very introspective to develop the deep, layered characters he did. I can imagine him in the audience of one of these plays and asking, \"What's the point? Is making revenge your life's goal really productive?\" \n Hamlet spends most of the play ruminating on such dilemmas, all the while feeling hogtied to a precept of revenge anchored to his sense of honor. Eventually, he goes about his life, letting it slide. Only through the unintended chaos of a sword fight--designed to kill Hamlet--did he follow through on his father's command to kill Claudius. With disastrous results all around. \n I've read analysis on the themes of Hamlet and learned that experts believe this exploration of the play itself is a factor. To me, it's a major takeaway. Perhaps because I feel the same way whenever I watch an action movie today. Really? I want to ask. Was all this destruction necessary? Why are the characters so dumb? A little forethought, please. \n I believe Shakespeare was pleading for just such depth of thought and character when he wrote this classic play.","date":"2017-02-10"}

The way Woodson weaves words and themes is beautiful. You'll notice I marked this as middle grade and adult fiction. That's because it's a story about a young girl, but it's complex and profound enough for adults to dive into and come out changed. Especially in light of our current political climate, books like these are so important to understanding others' experiences, especially those whose voices aren't heard enough. \n I beg you, especially if you are having a hard time understanding how racism still exists in our country or why movements like Black Lives Matter exist, to read books like this. Just because there's no longer slavery or lynchings or \"Whites Only\" bathrooms doesn't mean there's not still pain and confusion and inequality. This book is set in the 1960s, but there are still poignant messages to gain for our modern day. Mostly, though, this story is about one girl's childhood experiences, and while being black is a central theme to the book, it's not pedantic.

This book is just so raw. It is a complete outpouring of emotion and it made me feel so many too. I cried at the amount of herself Rupi has thrown into this story. I admire her for opening herself up so much to us. \n Although this is a collection of poems, it also follows a simple storyline - the journey of Rupi's self-acceptance and healing. It also includes some gorgeous little simple illustrations which fit perfectly with the poems. \n \"you were a dragon long before \n he came around and said \n you could fly \n you will remain a dragon \n long after he's left\" \n Overall, this book is tender, raw, sensitive and emotional.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"Immediately after I finished reading The Princess Saves Herself in this One, I had a friend suggest Milk and Honey to me. \n I'm not used to this kind of poetry with its shattering truths. The poetry I remember studying when I was in high school was nothing like this. \n Every bit as good as Amanda Lovelace's poetry collection, Rupi's writing made me feel like I was heard. It's a collection of poetry about love, loss, trauma, abuse, healing and femininity, split into four distinct chapters, serving different purposes yet linking together in a way I can only call incredibly cohesive. \n It made me cry during the third chapter about break ups and abuse and it made me feel like I was not alone. The final chapter, \"Healing\", was very much needed as a breather, and the love letter to the reader at the very end made me move to reach out to the author and thank her for her prose. \n These truths are not for the faint hearted. Certainly not for anyone immediately after a break up unless they feel incredibly strong. But I can already tell this collection is one I'll go back to again and again.","date":"2017-09-16"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"I don't read many books of poetry. Yet, I'm so glad to have picked this one up after seeing so many of my friends quoting it and loving it. \n It is true that some of the poems are \"basic\" or the line breaks are \"weird\". Doesn't matter. Not every poem is for you. These poems were not written for you. They are shared by the author for her own healing and in hopes that they will help heal whatever you need healing in. \n I found wisdoms in here that I want engraved in me for my future years. I found love and beauty that made me pause to appreciate it in myself. And I found pain that I wished I could shake off. Many words resonated with me and as time moves and experience grows I know more will touch me. Help me see I am not alone. \n In the simplicity of her poems I felt it easier to connect. As did many other non-avid and proper readers of poetry did. The line breaks I felt were part design. Stepping back, how the words lay on the page is a design, how the lines are broken make shapes and adds to everything she says. \n I read this so quickly that I'll need to reread and reread.","date":"2016-11-02"}

{"book_id":"12914","rating":5,"review_text":"Apparently I was misunderstanding some things. Sixteen-year-old girls do not read this book for fun, I found out. That explains why I was getting so many weird looks while reading this. Putting aside the fact that I do not know how to act my own age, I liked this a lot. It was very lyrical and beautiful. It made the rough, harsh parts of battles and wars into a beautiful layout. The blood and gore of it was washed away with flowery descriptions that I was in love with. I easily found myself falling for the easy flowing language that sprouted a whole new world for me to fall into. The story was really interesting, and complex, with all the little things that amounted to a great deal in the end. I was confused in some areas, so I had to go back and fact-check, but I assume that happens to all people who read this. So much was going on so it was easy to get lost. But it was good. Don't think that because it was easy to get confused that it was bad. It's good, yet holds a tad of confusion. It was very good, but I will admit I probably should have waited a while before reading it. I will most likely go back in a few years and give it another shot. But in total, I really liked it. It's a great way to get a feel for really old writings--especially an epic--and is a real joy to get lost in. I think it is a very descriptive and imaginative look at the Trojan War, and I frankly really glad to pick it up. It was a great change from my usual quotidian reads. Read this whenever you wish, but I will get a slight warning that you will want to set some time aside so you can get fully absorbed in it without too many interruptions. \n Thanks for acting like you're paying attention. \n All quotes pulled from the novel, and included bonus content. \n Carpe diem.","date":"2016-01-20"}

Ultimately, I have attempted to provide the English-speaking reader of today with a more accessible version of one of the great works of the Russian literary imagination, one that would speak in a familiar, not-too-distant English voice and that would convey not only something of the novel's sense and shape, but some hints of its characteristic flavour as well : its verve and sparkle, its lyricism and wit, its succinctness and variety...\" \n at:pr aamaar nijer pchnder kichu pNkti... \n raatbhr paartti shesse raajdhaanii shhre bhorer klrb... shunun... \n But what of my Eugene?

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"(Since writing this review I've been thinking over and over if I was being too critical/judgmental, so I'm editing this and trying to better express my thoughts!) \n This was quite underwhelming for me. I was interested in reading this after seeing screenshots of some of the poems online, but there were only a few more poems in addition to those three or four that really stood out to me. Most of them sound/read like those \"quotes\" or sayings you can find so easily on social media accounts today. So it's easy to say her work isn't art to be called poetry at all. But saying that is just subscribing to an elitist and limiting definition of what art is. True, I felt that her use of form (placing of line breaks) often distracted me, and I thought that many of the poems read like \"fillers\" that interrupted both the rhythm and mood of the poems as a whole collection. But I think they suffered from rather poor arrangement or organisation to fill a large \"collection\" of poems. \n Most of all, I appreciated the poems for their message and intention, and the poems that feel genuine and honest are truly beautiful. Rupi Kaur discussed difficult topics like abuse, rape and the need for self-love and self-respect (esp among women). Writing about these topics in spare, straightforward language made her poems come across honest, bold and hard-hitting. I like the simple one she wrote 'defining rape', and from that one I realized many of her poems /sound/ better than read, like in spoken word. Maybe that could take away the distracting use of line breaks?? Very likely though, a big problem is I can't/don't relate to a bunch of those struggles, but... nevertheless I felt like the poems I liked offered me new perspectives or new language to think about such experiences. Like the one about talking to her father on the phone. Or the one about the fire in her belly and being tough to swallow. Simplicity is welcome especially because we don't need more obstruction in our attempts to understand other experiences. And the ones I felt were like fillers were poems that didn't really offer much in terms of perspective and connection. So I think this collection suffered most from the organisation (sorry I can't think of a better word for this) of the poems, because there were a bit too many 'okay' poems almost literally breaking up the sincerity of the beautiful poems. Either way, I think it's wonderful she and her writing really connected with lots of readers! That kind of connection and resonance really is what literature is all about. \n Edit: I just came across this buzzfeed article (https://www.buzzfeed.com/chiaragiovan...) that kinda critiques this collection of poems, and it (plus its comments) was insightful about all the messy politics. I honestly would love to read something by writers of colour that does not focus so much on race or political issues generally (why not something happier? we're not all or always suffering...), so that their work won't continually go under scrutiny for cultural 'authenticity' and marketability... ugh :/// \n Edit again: I just watched Rupi Kaur's TED talk, and it was interesting and I think conveyed the sincerity of her poetry ten times better than this collection. Makes me think I was quite right about me enjoying her poems better as spoken word! Haha","date":"2017-07-20"}

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":4,"review_text":"Full review here \n Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars \n Short Review: Rankine's fusion of poetry, prose, and visual art is a fascinating look at everyday racism that will be very familiar to many Americans. \n Last night was our monthly book club meeting, and let me tell y'all- it was fantastic. Between bites from the moderately successful bibimbap bar, we discussed Citizen: An American Lyric, by Claudia Rankine. Citizen gained steam after a young black woman was seen reading it during a Donald Trump rally. \n For those unfamiliar with the book, or it's author, I recommend the introduction given here, and her readings from the book here. One of her first readings in the video is VI (which I refer to as My Brothers are Notorious). In the book, this poem is followed by a graphic image that most Americans have seen. The black and white photo depicts two African-Americans hanging from trees in the aftermath of a lynching. Rankine edits the photo, removing the assailed bodies, and leaving only the horde of white spectators. Here, Rankine changes the focus of the photo from the murdered to the murderers. Tucked in online footage of various interviews with Rankine, these small insights helped our group of otherwise artistically illiterate people understand Citizen's majesty. Afterward, we felt more capable of tackling Rankine's prose-poetry fusion. \n In the early stages of writing Citizen, Rankine went to her friends, asking them to recount for her a time \"when race entered the room.\" When they'd been allowed to forget for just a moment, but were suddenly reminded of their own differences- of their status as a second-class citizen. \n This compilation of stores is not entirely Rankine's own, despite her ability to display them with unsurprising familiarity. I say unsurprising because these are problems that plague all African-Americans, regardless of class and exacerbated by gender and sexual orientation. While these stories belong to her friends, they resonate widely. \n The beauty of this work is that it ranges from microagressions to macro, showing simplistic instances of everyday prejudice. Instances that range from neighbors calling the police on Rankine's black male babysitter, to racist jeers during Serena William's 2001 Indian Wells match. \n The first of these two sparked a large discussion, because one of the book club members had heard a similar story in real life. This story included his brother, who was mistaken for a home intruder while babysitting. At this point in our discussion, the discourse took a predictable detour, everyone chiming in with stories that could very easily have been featured in Citizen. \n For those who read Citizen with skepticism, let me assure you that these scenarios happen. Interviewers you've only spoken to on the phone will be surprised when their invited candidate shows up with dark skin, and tennis fans shout racial slurs at Serena while in the midst of a game. Rankine is not lying, nor is she exaggerating. \n Initially, our group had mixed feelings about Citizen. Some felt that too much of it was \"artsy,\" and didn't resonate with them as much as ordinary prose may have. For the record, I enjoyed nearly every minute of it, even though some of it went over my head. If you find it escaping you, I recommend reading this aloud, like I do most poetry. Only in reading it aloud did the group truly understand the desperation in the refrain \"my brother, dear brother, my dearest brothers, dear heart,\" or the incredulity in \"did you see their faces?\" \n Citizen is a book written to define what citizenship looks for those who cannot escape their black body. Moreover, is a book made to be read and discussed aloud. Read it with your book clubs, and discuss how very subversive racism, sexism, and every other type of -ism is in contemporary society. And if you have a thick enough skin, discuss your own roles in it, too.","date":"2016-01-17"}

{"book_id":"133906","rating":4,"review_text":"Let me start off by saying: \n * I don't even like poetry \n * We live in a time (August 2017) when the poems in this collection are highly relevant and, in my view, required reading \n * I should have started by reading one of Hughes' shorter collections; it would have cut out a lot of the weaker poems \n This huge, exhaustive collection of Langston Hughes' works contains all kinds of poems. There are political ones--Communist, mostly, as that seems to have been Hughes' ideal. There are ones about race and the black experience in America. There are other snapshot-like poems on various topics, some of them hinting at Hughes being a homosexual, as was suspected. \n My favourite poems from this collection are the ones about racism and, more broadly, being black in America from the 1920s to the 1960s. They are powerful without being overwritten or obscene. They tell a lot in a few simple stanzas. What's more, reading them made me indescribably sad at how much of the world that Hughes wished people would live in by now--and which he predicted for the future--is not yet a reality. It's horrific to see how much of the struggles of black people (and other marginalized populations) continue at the same level as 75 years ago. It makes you ask: How much have we really done? Will people hate others for the colour of their skin forever? A maddening road to travel down, and one that many people of colour are forced to travel to this day. \n For a list of my favourite poems, please visit: https://imgur.com/gallery/AGUcS \n I wasn't a big fan of the rest of the poems in this collection. There are many short poems (1-3 stanzas) that consist of an intriguing concept, but don't develop the thought in full. Also, there are a chunk of poems hailing Communism--specifically the Russian and Chinese variety. Regardless of my views on the subject (that you shouldn't glorify any political system), the poems aren't written very... poetically. They read like a manifesto, and the momentum of the collection as a whole is lost whenever one of the drier of these poems appears. \n It is difficult to rate this book because some of the poems are 5* are others are 2*. Overall, my rating system is such that 4* means I would read other books like this, and 3* means reading this kind of book once was enough. While I might not have loved every poem, I would certainly read other similar books.","date":"2016-12-13"}

Nobody recommended it to me, it just seemed like the next thing to read. \n I enjoyed it although not as much as Homer's works. The challenge for me was (and I was not sophisticated enough at the time to understand this) that Homer's works were essentially Hero's Journeys, The Aeneid was a founding mythology.

I couldn't put it down once I'd started reading and finished it in one sitting. Really lovely. \n I don't think this book does what one expects a book of poetry to do in terms of language and metaphor. It came across very simple and confessional which worked powerfully and moved the story of the book, but there weren't a lot of poems within it that I would set aside and say that they are my favorite poems by themselves.

{"book_id":"1420","rating":4,"review_text":"On the face of it, Hamlet is about a Danish prince taking revenge for his father's death at the hands of his uncle. Or rather, struggling to take revenge. Thinking about it, pondering it, and pretending to go mad. Then going mad, falling in love and a lot more besides. This in a play that, uncut, runs for more than four hours. Hamlet is a revenge drama, but it consists of Hamlet's inability to take revenge. The character's beautiful, desperate reflection on his situation have given rise to many interpretations of the tragedy. Is it a political, psychological or family drama? Is Hamlet a madman, genius, narcissist or revolutionary? \n These are the themes I noticed as I watched, read and listened to the play: \n The Difficulty of Certainty \n Hamlet's desire for revenge conflicts with the religious norms and the codes of society. Enacting his desire for revenge means that Hamlet's soul could be in danger. His reasons for revenge and justice become conflicted and confused. There is no certainty as to what will happen if he follows his heart. \n So, Hamlet does not commit to action until he convinces himself that what he's doing is definitely correct. It's difficult to take rational action when there is a need for certainty in an ambiguous world. Hamlet does not give an answer to what is best: taking action, or not. Rather he suggests that no matter which one you choose the end result is the same: death. \n Perspectives on Death \n Following on from the death of his father, Hamlet obsesses over mortality and death. He looks at it from many different angles and poses lots of questions. Do kings have a free pass to heaven? Is there an afterlife? If you're murdered will you go to heaven? Will answers to these questions bring Hamlet peace? Maybe not, as death is the result of his desire for justice and revenge. It is also the cause of it too. \n Hamlet describes the world as an \"unweeded garden\". He only seems comfortable with things that are dead. He reveres his father and claims to love Ophelia once she's dead. He believes that death isn't too bad. He obsesses over the idea of suicide. But the uncertainty of the afterlife pushes Hamlet away from taking his own life. And in Act V after seeing Yorick's skull he realises that death levels any differences between people. \n As the play progresses the quantity of bodies pile up. Even though eight of the nine main characters die, questions of mortality are not answered. The play provides an exploration without any definite conclusion. \n Hamlet argues that death is the one true reality. He seems to view all life as \"appearance\" doing everything it can, from desiring power, to hiding the truth, to murder, to hide from reality. \n The Nation's Health \n Power transfers from one King to another. This causes anxiety and political turmoil; how morally legitimate is the ruler? And how healthy does this make the nation, if the ruler himself is rotten? Denmark's national health is failing. \n When Marcellus says, \"something is rotten in the state of Denmark\" (Act I, Scene IV), he's suggesting that something evil is afoot. It refers to political unrest which links to Hamlet's mental state. \n Reality and Deception \n Each character ponders what other characters are thinking. Deception is rife. Hamlet is unable to act because of his search for reality. He initially feigns madness. This is to convince others that he is harmless while investigating his father's death. He builds on this appearance of insanity and discovers the closer he looks the more false reality becomes. As the play progresses, Hamlet's deception of playing mad seems to cause him to lose his grip on reality. In other words he becomes insane. Or so it appears. \n In Conclusion \n I think the play is so enduring because of Hamlet's delay. He has an inability, or refusal, to go ahead and avenge his father. And his habit of stepping out of the plot to reflect on how the working of the mind might explain his inaction. For me, it is these aspects of the play that has kept it fresh and modern. Each generation in turn interprets Hamlet in light of the way we explain our own lives. \n Resources I Used \n \"Hamlet\" (York Notes Advanced) by Jeffrey Wood \n Chop Bard podcast; episodes 21 to 39 inclusive. \n Chop Bard podcast Hamlet (1990) movie, starring Mel Gibson \n Chop Bard podcast Hamlet (2009) movie, starring David Tennent","date":"2016-01-29"}

{"book_id":"6656","rating":5,"review_text":"I read Inferno in college, Mandelbaum's translation, with its superb endnotes. I decided to read his complete translation of all three parts of the Divine Comedy found in Everyman's Library. It was difficult, painstaking reading, as I wanted to make sure I \"got\" everything, and the endnotes were essential (and excellent) in this regard. I had to read each Canto at least twice however, and certain parts of Purgatorio and Paradisio were fantastically difficult. \n Dante leaves one speechless. The Divine Comedy is so incredibly unique and unusual, writing about it presents difficulties as it does not fall within the traditional novel or epic format. Certain things are easy to talk about - Dante in his historical context or Dante and Catholicism, or Dante and the classical writers, but what is difficult is saying just exactly what the Divine Comedy is? Surely it is great poetry, and an incredible piece of fantastical literature (the demons and the tar pit is surely the best scene), and a deeply powerful spiritual and religious work, but to me the real question was whether or not Dante is completely insane, or whether he's touched on something truly essential either about religion or about the human experience. I think the fact that you're never quite sure is part of the unique genius of this work. \n So I find that I'm able to say a few things, but I'm truly unable to capture the work in language, in the same way Dante in Paradisio (Canto I, and throughout) Dante says that he is incapable of describing paradise. I will say that you can't read Inferno by itself - you really have to read the whole thing - and honestly I think Purgatorio is better than Inferno, despite an ending which is so bizarre (again, divinely inspired or is he crazy?), and the maligned Paradisio is as fine as its two predecessors. I am continually amazed by Dante, he is so creative (or are these genuine visions?) and the book has these touches of \"reality\" to it that make it seem like an actual experience. \n Finally, the Divine Comedy clearly has to belong in the Western Canon because of its influence throughout the ages. It's not even a question whether this is \"required\" reading, failure to read it is like visiting Rome and missing out on the Colosseum. But to recommend it in its own right to a lay reader - I wouldn't say it is \"enjoyable\" - but its artistic achievement is mind-boggling, reading it is like walking through the Uffizi or the Vatican Rooms, with each encounter with a denizen a \"painting\". It's not \"fun\", like Paradise Lost was or Rabelais or pretty much anyone else on the Powys list. What to say? The DC is a plunge into a bath of awesome insanity, a wild, bizarre, religious head trip. Like the very best literature, there's nothing else like it.","date":"2016-09-29"}

You feel her love, her loss, but most of all her inner strength. She's such a great motivation to women everywhere. My heart was touched by her stories. Though each poem is unique, they all tie together to describe the story of a woman who gave so much to be loved, but what she discovers is how to love herself. \n It's been a really long time since I've read poetry. For the longest time I thought I needed to be more \"serious\" and \"philosophical\" to understand it. But I've come to find that that is not the case, especially with this collection. Her words are so direct and real that its meaning is clear and hits you hard. In addition to beautiful writing, the book itself is gorgeous! Each illustration is drawn in such a way to represent the poem. Some are drawn roughly for grittier poems. Others have definite lines and curves that exude times of confidence. I can't say enough about this. It's truly a work of art. \n I recommend this poetry collection to anyone who loves beautiful writing or if you've ever had a broken heart. I wouldn't recommend to younger readers as some of the poems can get a little descriptive. But in those words, you feel her raw emotion. She spills her heart out onto the pages and I'm so blessed as to receive it. Definitely a great read!","date":"2016-05-10"}

It reminded me of why I love words and description and their way of both creating a world and burning it down. \n It reminded me that less is more \n This book hurts too. It is uncomfortable like a truth you don't want to swallow.

{"book_id":"18263725","rating":5,"review_text":"This book is a gem. A long poem, an ode to basketball, a paean to twinship, a salute to family. Alexander takes us through one twin's journey as he and his brother play some masterful ball, diverge in their paths (what happens when a twin gets his first girlfriend?), and struggle through a family trauma. Every character, from mom to dad to each twin, to the new girlfriend, lifts off the page. Ate this up in a night. I need to re-read it to fully appreciate the rise, fall, beauty, and pain of each verse.

Then there is brief woman drama, and then more fighting.

{"book_id":"5936","rating":2,"review_text":"I Liked Pablo Neruda's writing, I believe his raw passion speaks to all of us on a universal level. It's so human and bare, it is his monument left to us. This is an amazing collection which begins with his early work to his retrospective years, it shows you this amazing evolution of his writing and how powerful it becomes. Some poems really hit home where some of them really confused me. These poems really made this book a quite interesting read for me. \n And I in these lines say: \n Like this I want you, love, \n love, Like this I love you, \n as you dress \n and how your hair lifts up \n and how your mouth smiles, \n light as the water \n of the spring upon the pure stones, \n Like this I love you, beloved...\" \n -Pablo Neruda \n I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her. \n My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing. \n Another's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before. \n Her voice. Her bright body. Her inifinite eyes. \n I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her. \n Love is so short, forgetting is so long. \n Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms \n my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her. \n \"I will bring you happy flowers from the mountains, bluebells, dark hazels, and rustic baskets of kisses. \n I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees.\" \n You discovered \n His thoughts, \n His words, his love, \n His passionate \n Intensity \n In a tiny book \n That's now \n Well-fingered. \n Then you added your own \n Unique voice, your arms \n Your legs, your body \n And your love, \n So that in turn \n You might be loved \n And you were \n And still, my heart, \n Again, you are. \n This is definitely my first book of Pablo's but not the last.

Like literally it touched my heart!! The start was so good that I thought WOW IT'S GONNA BE A MASTERPIECE. But I was wrong, I don't know why was this hype about. This book was all about blood, stitches, roads, dreams. and some of the poems was so confusing, I didn't even get what exactly the poet was trying to convey. I just couldn't relate my self with the narrator. It was really annoying how his moods were shifting through every verse. At one point it was hard getting from one page to another. Although, this book was pretty much short. \n I liked some of poetry which made me want to finish this book. So, I did and here we are giving this book a 2 Star, JUST because I liked some poetry, and DAMN what a poetry that was! Made me incapable of escaping this book. \n \"Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us. \n These, our bodies, possessed by light. \n Tell me we'll never get used to it.\" \n These Lines really hit home.

That means it's noon, that means \n we're inconsolable. \n Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us. \n These, our bodies, possessed by light. \n Tell me we'll never get used to it.\" \n How can love ruin us?? It can't Love make us see light and sometimes the fucking stars, it make us see this world in new light and make us think every thought twice. We can literally see before and after love that how much it changed us. and i loved how author point out the real meaning behind it. These were the moment I LOVED this book very much. I hoped that every line would've been THIS great for me!! But unfortunately this was NOT for me. \n \"A man takes his sadness down to the river and throws it in the river \n but then he's still left \n with the river.

You will find here no spiritual guidance. No philosophy, cosmology, theology, and no theodicy. This book neither addresses or solves the problems of the human condition. The people of Orphalese listen to their prophet as he explains love, suffering, work, death, faith, and life with elegant words. But he truly explains nothing. His sole purpose seems to be to comfort and cheer up the people. \n The prophet is great at showing the spiritual side of daily life. Work, love, giving, death, desire, all have meaning and are good. The prophet is never asked the big questions like, \"What is reality? Who or what created the universe? Who am I? Where did I come from? Where am I going?\" \n If you are looking for answers to spiritual problems, this is not your book. This is a book that is for someone who is satisfied with a spirituality or philosophy that will get them high and make all their problems go away for a little while.","date":"2016-02-02"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"4 Stars \n Overall: \n One of the first poetry collections I've read in a while, and one I really enjoyed. I understand there has been a rise in 'modern-contemporary' poems, or 'tumblr-speak.' From what I've seen people either love or hate it. \n I personally really enjoyed it. I'm by no means a poetry connoisseur but I believe poetry should be a very personal thing. I care little about the formatting and more about the words themselves. For me, poetry is always a hard thing to review because it is so personal, so this is going to be short and simple \n Pros: \n This addresses some really powerful and harrowing topics I believe are very relevant to women today. Again, very personal to even read and I think Rupi Kaur managed to convey of difficult ideas and emotions in very short works \n I liked the variety both in length and style with the poems and I thought the illustrations fit very well. \n A strong theme of self-confidence and finding strength in one's self ran throughout this entire collection--each section builds upon it until it cultivates in the last fourth. Overall, I think it's a very important message and I enjoyed the way it was handled. \n Cons: \n This did get a little repetitive. The collection is split into four sections and I couldn't help but feel like perhaps each section was a little longer than it needed to be. Beautiful words, just conveying thoughts that had already been expressed several times. \n In Conclusion: Powerful stuff, just felt a little repetitive in places!","date":"2016-12-01"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"http://literary-lion.tumblr.com/ \n \"The thing about writing is I can't tell if it's healing or destroying.\" \n Kaur's poetry is immensely personal and powerful - but I just didn't connect with it the way I'd hoped to. A modern poetry collection that focuses on abuse, love, loss and feminism it's easy to see why milk and honey rose to popularity so quickly, but it's simply not for everyone. \n Ultimately I cannot truly judge something that is so personal to Kaur. Her emotions and past are laid bare on these pages but I see so little of myself here that I could not feel anything for most of the poems. I do love poetry and I have fell deeply in love with books of a similar style - just not this one. \n I also felt a few of the themes were a bit repetitive. There were several poems about women having body hair, and though I am a strong supporter of hairy legs I don't know if I am three plus poems emotional about it. \n Kaur's drawings are unique and interesting, some of the poems did connect with me but ultimately I didn't really care for the collection. It felt like there was too little story and too much self-praise. The poems themselves aren't particularly exceptional and there were several that were just large text blocks that hurt to read. \n All in all many of the poems read like very pretty quotes to reblog or pin or place on a wall but don't quite turn into nice poems. \n I desperately searched for love in these pages, and came out empty handed and broken hearted.","date":"2016-08-20"}

There's a bravery to them, a lust for living in the face of all odds that one has to admire. \n Life has kicked Bukowski's characters (or are they himself, by proxy?) around so often and for so long, but has yet to break them, nor ever will. Theirs is the courage of those who fate has not been kind to, yet who can still muster a smile in defiance of it. There is a nobility to this the more privileged of us would do well to keep in mind. \n Plus, did I mention that a lot of his stories are funny? All right, hilarious.....","date":"2016-07-27"}

Aside from these aspects, however, I didn't like it so much as simply understand it. I did understand, I think, why she writes the way she does: I saw the book as an expression of how the experience of emotion truly is, sometimes coming in short bursts, sometimes in long waves where you wallow in the emotion for a while. I was hoping for some more poems of sizable length than there were, though. I think I understand why she wrote in such simple, short language- for the purpose of frankness, and because such big, complex emotions cannot always be eloquently expressed or fully explored- but I for one am not a fan of minimalist writing styles. Some of the fragments did also come off as trite. I rated it midway for this reason- I liked some aspects, and some I did not, but it was a moving work overall.","date":"2016-06-21"}

That said, I do know I'm a bit in love with milk and honey, candid and sometimes cutting, I found that I saw myself in many of her poems as I can imagine more than a few people would as well.

I'm laughing right now because it's only today I found a quote that basically says what I mean much more eloquently: \n \"You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read.

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":5,"review_text":"I very rarely read books written in verse, but when I do, I am usually pleasantly surprised. Brown Girl Dreaming is a memoir written in verse form. The whole middle-grade book is written in simple, free verse poems. \n Simple, but astoundingly beautiful. Succinct is probably a more apt description than simple. At times, heartbreaking. And absolutely and without a doubt, there is more there than meets the eye. \n Jacqueline Woodson won the National Book Award in 2014 for Brown Girl Dreaming. Her book was also a Newbery Honor Book, and winner of the Coretta Scott King Award. She deserves all of the accolades, and more. \n Brown Girl Dreaming is largely about Jacqueline's childhood, from her early childhood years in the 1960s in Greenville, South Carolina through her family's move to NYC and her elementary school years, when she first discovered her interest in writing. I loved hearing her stories from Greenville, when she lived with her mom, siblings, and grandparents. Her grandfather became a father-figure to her, and her love for her grandparents and their importance in her life is a big part of her story. \n Don't be fooled that this is just a memoir. Woodson delves into everything from the Civil Rights movement, to moving from Ohio, to the Jim Crow American South, to New York. From race to religion, she does not sugarcoat what it is like to grow up black in the 1960s and 70s, both in the South and the North. \n This is a book for everyone. But most especially, Brown Girl Dreaming is a book for elementary and middle-school aged girls. Girls who may not have an easy time at home. Girls who are PoC. Girls who may not fit the typical academic mold. Girls who don't think of themselves as great because they don't fit the typical academic mold. For any and all of the above type of girls, this is a must-read. \n Yes, you can speed through this book in one sitting, as fast as my husband's family consumes our Thanksgiving dinner. But, the book is much better suited to the Slow Food movement: pace yourself, slowly and thoughtfully, as you read and digest her words.","date":"2016-12-08"}

I found it very interesting how the writer portrays Satan. In a lot of ways, he made Satan a tragic hero in the beginning. He does turn more viperous as the story goes along which is to be expected because he is Satan after all and he has been banished for his rebellion. I also liked how nothing was black and white with the story and characters. It really was an interesting way to look at some big events of the Bible. \n It never seemed to end. Pages and pages of long drawn-out verses. It took forever to make a simple point and progress the story. The footnotes were helpful in some spots, but sometimes overly explaining aspects that didn't need it. \n However....the poetry itself was BEAUTIFUL. The author really knows his way around a rhyme and a prose. Boring but beautiful. Can that even exist? \n This was worth the read.

{"book_id":"22151696","rating":1,"review_text":"I had a holiday today, I was way behind on my reading schedule, and I wanted some...entertainment. First of all, let's talk a little about Ms Leav's Introduction to this collection of crap. \n I have always thought poems were a little like spells-incantations that are as old as time. There is a certain quality to words that-when strung in a certain way-has an almost hypnotic effect \n , she writes. Does she fucking realise how ironic this statement is, seeing as how she is completely incapable of stringing words together in that \"certain\" way? Or, in any way, in fact? Also, Ms Leav, I'm going to dock points for the inappropriate use of a dash. Or two. She continues, \n This combined with the universal theme of love, becomes ever more potent and intoxicating. After all, what greater magic is there than love? \n Is it just me, or does she sound awfully smug here? I feel like she's scoffing at everyone because she's discovered an easy way to make money. It's almost as if she's informing us all that the formula for \"poetry\" is quite simple; any combination of words strung together, preaching the transcendent and universal nature of love. \n Much like a mirror reflecting its ever-changing landscape, Lullabies is a book that, over time, will reveal itself to you slowly. \n Much Love, \n Lang \n She should've concluded with \"Much Pretence, Lang\" instead. \n Now, on to the poetry itself. \n Clocks \n Here in time, \n you are mine; \n my heart has not \n sung louder. \n I do not know \n why I love you so- \n the clock knows not \n its hour. \n Yet it is clear, \n to all that's here, \n that time is told \n by seeing. \n Even though \n clocks do not know, \n it is the reason \n for their being. \n What the actual fuck is \"time is told by seeing\" supposed to mean? And, yes, Ms Leav, by virtue of being clocks, i.e., inanimate objects that cannot \"know\", clocks don't \"know\" anything, much less that the reason for their being is...that time is told by seeing? \n Wounded \n A bruise is tender \n but does not last, \n it leaves me as \n I always was. \n But a wound I take \n much more to heart, \n for a scar will always \n leave its mark. \n And if you should ask \n which one you are, \n my answer is- \n you are a scar. \n When I was younger, like way, way younger, I used to write poetry. Something like \n \"I love Spring, it's so awesome, \n look, there's a cherry blossom\" \n It was shitty poetry, and still, still, much better than this cornucopia of awfulness. \n Tell Me \n Tell me if you ever cared, \n if a single thought \n or me was spared. \n Tell me when you lie in bed, \n do you think of something \n I once said. \n Tell me if you hurt at all, \n when someone says \n my name with yours. \n It may have been so long ago, \n but I would give \n the world to know. \n I would give the world to know how much time it takes to come up with this drivel. \n I'm not completely a horrible person, so I will give Ms Leav two things. One, that this is marginally better than her first collection of \"poems\", and two, that she is a good artist. Maybe if she stuck to the latter...","date":"2016-10-31"}

Poetry is about feeling, but it's also about language. In fact, I would have given her the \"feelings\" argument if even one of her poems made me feel anything. I mostly just laughed a lot, and I laughed at her, not with her. Ms. Leav just comes off as pathetic and desperate in all her poems. And man, she needs to take up creative writing classes, because this is just bad. I feel like I could write better poems than her when I'm senselessly drunk even. She's somehow missed the whole point of poetry, because in poetry, it is the language that makes you feel.","date":"2016-09-11"}

{"book_id":"45974","rating":3,"review_text":"This is not a normal book. \n This book is something else. \n This book doesn't tell standard story. \n This book tells philosophical quotes surrounding what may or may not be a fictional character. \n And because of it, it got old REALLY fast. \n I will not deny the fact that Fernando Pessoa's \"The Book of Disquiet\" may be one of the most beautiful books ever written in terms of its writing. Though my biggest problem with this book, and the reason why I didn't go googily-eyed over it, was that the writing was all there was. No real story. No real characters. Not even a hint of a narrative in the writing. All it basically is is a stream of poetic and philosophical quotes that may or may not create a story. It really just matters on how you interpret it. Yes, the first 100 pages captures your fancy, but the rest of the book is just a show and tell about some project you know you did well on but you want to make it clear on how good it is. I was honestly annoyed with Pessoa once I was two-thirds of the way through this book and I knew that this kind of book is not for me. I tend to stick with books that is more focused on story and characters than the writing. I just tend to find books centered around their writing falling into one of two categories. One is that the book is just AWFUL. However, there is another category where this book falls under. This category is books that try too hard. This book isn't bad AT ALL.

{"book_id":"27822","rating":4,"review_text":"I have been on a ROLL with good books lately. Even though I am changing one to a 2 out of 5 after I make this review, I do think that the majority of what I have read in May so far has been of exceptional quality. I really enjoyed this. However, I can split this book into two halves. The first half is the decent part. The second half is the AMAZING part. The first part is riddled with Pushkin playing around with the verse style he chooses and goes on a little too long describing things, taking up whole sections of the book to describing pointless actions like getting dressed and going through a room. Then comes the second half where the intensity of the story comes in. The impact the story makes to the reader in the second half is one that is both tragic and addictive. I saw myself flying through the second half in one sitting and it was truly a wonderful experience. Pushkin's writing became even more beautiful and brilliant as the story itself progressed and improved immensely. So with that in, I thought \"Eugene Onegin\" was a really good book. It may be a book I appreciated more than enjoyed, but it was a very well done book for being so old. This kind of thing has never been done before this book was published and it was a revolutionary book for its time. Even today, almost 200 years later, it still is of exceptional quality. So, I do highly recommend \"Eugene Onegin,\" especially to those who are just getting into Russian literature. \n I am giving this one a 4 out of 5 stars.","date":"2017-02-24"}
{"book_id":"253264","rating":4,"review_text":"OLD REVIEW: \n Amazing. A masterpiece of theatre that no one should miss. I am in utter shock on how much this play made me think. It was not what I was expecting, but it was better than what I was expecting. It encompasses on how people react to God and questioning God and ultimately going in the ways of progress versus the people who are staying with tradition. \n This is ultimately the story of the Scopes Monkey Trial, for which is the most famous trial and most significant trial of the 20th century, if not in American history. This play exposes on how terrible and literal people can be when it comes to what they believe in. It shows how people reject other points of view mainly because they are just not comfortable with what they hear. As a person who is a HUGE supporter for progressivism and the ways of progress and innovation, this opened my eyes on how important this trial really was. This play may technically have been fictional, but I have also heard it is VERY realistic and true to the spirit of the case. So, when I see how the characters treated the idea of evolution and an idea that isn't fully fitted with the Christian views, it both breaks my heart and inspires me to support the ways of progress and equality and TRUE independence. I want to draw one quote from this play before I end this review. \n \"Religion's supposed to comfort people, isn't it? Not frighten them to death!\" (Lawrence 77) \n I have thought about my faith for about a couple of years now, but I have done it in a way where I have challenged it to strengthen it. However, whenever I see people use God in a way as to frighten others, like it is explained in this quote, I just cannot come to myself supporting something like this. I believe there is something out there, but it certainly not what most people think is out there. I am a spiritual man and not much of a religious man, and this play only strengthen the spirit of that. \n \"Inherit the Wind\" can now safely and confidently make its place along side \"Waiting for Godot\" and \"Hamlet\" as one of my FAVORITE plays of all time and being the third play to receive a 5 out of 5 rating from me. I cannot put into words on how this play can change someone. Just read it for yourself and see what you come up with. I adored this and will definitely keep on adoring this. \n I am giving this one a 5 out of 5 stars. \n NEW REVIEW: \n While I still think this play is brilliant as commentary and as a study of progression, I don't think the story of it can handle a 5 out of 5 stars. I just think this play is great but not a masterful story. I am currently editing my favorites list and replacing 5 star ratings and creating new ones. This is just one I don't love as much anymore to handle a 5 star rating. It is a great play and I do love it, but it is not at the level of \"Hamlet\" and \"Waiting for Godot.\" \n I am giving this one a 4.5 out of 5 stars.","date":"2016-08-26"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"OMG. This was amazing. I really haven't read poetry like that because I guess I never gotten around to picking up this genre. But my cousin was like you have to read this so I was like okay, I'm open to the suggestion and picked this book up. I'm glad I did because I feel buoyed on self-love! Thank you Rupi for this beautiful work of art. \n My goodness, this was a roller coaster of emotions. It truly and honestly made me FEEL and I love books like that. I was rereading the majority of the poems as soon as I finished them because it was just filled with emotion. That's another thing I loved about this, I could tell that each verse encompassed pieces of the authors heart. \n My favorite chapter was 'the healing' section because I felt so empowered. Rupi dropped the mic in some many verses. My goodness. I definitely recommend and I definitely will be picking up more poetry.","date":"2017-04-07"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"This book had a very important message within it. That you should be happy with who you are and that you don't need anyone else to make you whole. Some of the drawings and poems within the poetry collection were a bit confronting, but were there to merely offer understanding and to convey a certain feeling to the reader. I gave it a 3.5 as its overall rating. \n It had a lot of mature content in it, but I loved a lot of the poems and gained some life lessons as well. The illustrations within it were simple yet beautiful. \n This collection also inspired me to make my own poetry and I am very happy with it. I liked the fact that the poems were mostly so simple yet so powerful. \n Overall I think the message was clear and important, especially for women and it was a great and empowering read. Happy reading :)","date":"2017-01-16"}

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":5,"review_text":"I am reading through the assortment of National Book Award Winners and Finalists from last year. This was the next one on my list. My relationship with poetry is a weird one - I like writing it, I am studying it in an MFA program, but often find that a lot of the stuff I read misses the mark with connecting with me. Not a problem since I read so much and there's lots of poetry out there. I say all of this because I did not think the format of this would allow me to connect with the text. I was wrong. This is one of the best collections I've read in a long time (IMO, better than the one that won). \n It's racially charged but so is our world. I enjoyed Rankine's work so much that I am gonna go read the other works she has published. \n \"Yesterday, I begin, I was waiting in the car for time to pass. A woman pulled in and started to park her car facing mine. Our eyes met and what passed passed as quickly as the look away. She backed up and parked on the other side of the lot.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"So I feel like this is a collection that either clicks with you or it doesn't. In that, I mean it's polarizing. For me, I pick up poetry pretty rarely. Like once a year MAYBE. So when I do, it's not only for the gut-punch of emotional connection, but for the lyricism and those bumper-sticker-worthy quotes I cling to for years to come. \n Milk and Honey doesn't offer that lyricism. Or that emotional gut-punch. Not for me anyway. Not to diminish the work Kaur put into this, but I felt most of the poems were just kind of. Conversational statements. Or confessions. A lot of them were political. A lot of them were shocking. And they've obviously resonated with a great number of people. For me, the topics dealt with weren't particularly shocking or new to read about, and they weren't handled in a particularly fresh or creative way. \n I don't want to take away anything from her own personal journey or the art she created, but I personally didn't get anything out of it, and I feel people who read poetry often will get even less from it.","date":"2017-03-14"}

{"book_id":"22151696","rating":3,"review_text":"Actual rating: 3.5 stars \n I really enjoy Lang Leav's style and I'm only giving it 3.5 stars because I actually loved her first book much more. \n Usually, I don't like when poets rhyme. I feel like it can feel limiting and artificial, but Leav uses it in a sophisticated and beautiful way. Her poetry sounds whimsical and childlike, while still expressing emotions and heart aches of any adult. \n For me, her strength lies in her short stories. The metaphors and analogies she uses are insightful and delicate. \n I do feel this felt like it dragged on after page 80ish and I think some of her poems could have been edited out or down. But it was beautiful. She's the poet who really got me into poetry with Love and Misadventures which is a 5 star book and I highly recommend it.

The beat generation turns into the lost generation. The howl is still there.

I guess it is really hard to find any compilation of poems that all speak to the reader, but this one had a few too many poems that I really did not care for, were offensive and over the top. Of course the author didnt write these with my morality in mind so I guess that is to be expected.

His immense influence on modernism is clearly evident, but his use of mythology and literary references made reading his poems feel at times as if each line was disconnected from the rest. I consider myself fairly well read in classical literature, mythology etc. but I felt as if I needed an interpreter through much of the material. Not to interpret the overall meaning of the poem, but to understand some of the individual ideas/works that were referenced.

{"book_id":"53498","rating":3,"review_text":"Once again I have to admit that this is not my favorite style of book or poetry. I just don't get it, but here's what I did like - 1. This is very easy to read. 2. It is from a boy's perspective and he's not interested in poetry at the beginning of the story. 3. The boy changes his mind with the apparent caring support of his teacher. 4. The teacher introduces the class to poetry which inspires Jack to write. 5. The poems used for inspiration are included in the back of the book. 6. An author coming to visit the school is the most exciting thing to the boy which is great.","date":"2016-08-30"}
{"book_id":"15997","rating":3,"review_text":"Had this work ended after Part I or Part II, I would be giving it five stars. Satan is a fascinating, compelling figure, and those sections and every subsequent section thereafter where he appears is riveting. Unfortunately, the rest of the poem drags it down. Even setting aside the prejudices of Milton and his times (and the poem contains anti-feminist, anti-Catholic, and anti-science rants), and even ignoring the fact that the whole thing is in part an attempt to rationalize a rather tangled mythology, the characters and the narrator are long-winded to the point of tedium, never using one word when a hundred might do. To be fair, some of the extended descriptions are vivid and beautiful, and when a character is interesting, like Satan or occasionally Eve, this is fine and even brilliant. But when the narration or characters are dull (such as, to use one of many examples, God's extended whine about how none of this is his fault), it bogs down considerably. I'm glad I read it, and I understand why the poem is as famous as it is, but I found my attention wandering away and back depending on when Satan was going to do something.","date":"2017-02-02"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"Hi! \n From the book: \n \"you must enter a relationship \n with yourself \n before anyone else\" \n -Rupi Kaur, Milk & Honey \n Thanks for joining in on this week's book review of Milk & Honey by Rupi Kaur. I had saw this book on the Amazon best seller and then again in Target and thought it would be a good idea to check it out. \n My first impression of the work left me with a sense that life is a journey and sometimes the best way to cope is to do what you love. Kaur chose to write to deal with trauma and experiences in her life as many poets do. As a poet, Kaur took me on a journey whether short or long. The shorter one's left me wanting more in which most of the book did. Most free verse poetry takes the reader on a journey and in the writers words one can tell where the pauses are and so forth before moving on. I questioned whether some of the poems were complete because there was hardly any punctuation in the book other than in the prose. Some of the poems reminded me of things that I'd been hearing throughout life and were sentences separated by the word enter or just line breaks. I could relate to some of the poems but I still wanted there to be more. \n Aside from that, I thought the poems were okay. There were similar themes in each chapter. The graphics added a nice touch to some of the poems. This is definitely not a kid friendly poetry book. Some of the poems were explicit in nature. In the words, the author displays how people stay with people who hurt them, love those who leave and have to learn to love themselves. If you can get past how short most of the pieces are, there is a story that brings the whole book together about survival. \n I like this book. I recommend this book to anyone who likes Haiku's possibly or short poetry. \n Peace & Love \n -Lady T \n This book can be purchased here: http://a.co/0Gqkwra","date":"2017-03-15"}

Don't get me wrong guys, I gave it 4 stars (maybe even 4,5 ;)) which means that in my opinion, it is an excellent book!

I adore her and her art so much and I hope she's happy and will be for the rest of her life, because you know what, she deserves it. She deserves it so so badly.

You really can't and according to Jacqueline's grandmother, only one person can do that in the end. (Hint: it's God) \n So, what's the premise? An African American girl grows up in the 1960s and 70s... and yeah, that's about it. And that's all there really needs to be. The story of Jacqueline growing up amid the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Power Movement, and other tumultuous events during that time is enough to move the story forward. \n Told in free-verse, her experiences are visceral and stay with us because we can empathize. The language she uses lets us reflect on these similar feelings in our own childhood. Growing up as a child of the outdoors, I completely understood when she talked about \"smelling the air\" and having one foot in two different places. Her language in the beginning is very simple, reflecting her own writing style and understanding language early in her life. As she is given the opportunity and the education to write, she finds her talent with words in a way that her sister has talent with reading and her brother has a great singing voice. \n Something that bothered me in the review was the fact that I always wanted more. I knew that these were small snapshots into her life, but I wanted longer poems - more poems. As a winner of the Newbery, it's pretty obvious who this was centered towards. I can respect that this is just an outline or a brief overview. As these emotions come out from memories and looking through older pictures, she can express it quickly and with detail. \n She doesn't need to tell you (the reader) the whole story. There's nothing intense to tell. Jacqueline didn't have a sensational thing happen to her in the sense of headline news - but I think she did. \n She survived and she thrived. \n How can I explain to anyone that stories \n are like air to me, \n I breathe them in and let them out \n over and over again.","date":"2016-01-25"}

{"book_id":"765427","rating":3,"review_text":"First book: Delightful! Many of the scenes got to be a little boring, but overall, I loved this book. Maybe it was because I was forcing my own interpretations of the character dynamics and situations on the story, but I really did enjoy it. Una is great, Redcrosse is very interesting, and the Una/Redcrosse/Arthur teamup was so much fun! The conflicts all worked well, especially the ones toward the end. I liked it. \n Second book: Eh... not so much. This book is much more scattered than the first, and /so/ much more didactic. There isn't so much a sense of the story going somewhere organically; it's just Spenser shoving his characters into various moralizing situations. My favorite scene was the one with Braggadochio and the beautiful huntswoman - I firmly believe that any Spenserian woman threatened with rape should attempt to stab her attacker with a spear, rendering him too afraid to chase her when she runs away. Good problem solving, mystery woman. But it was a mystery, and I'm still not really sure why that scene was even in this book, as nothing about it affects anything else in the story. Maybe I need to read it more than once, but it just didn't flow as well as the first book, or with as many interesting characters and conflicts. \n Third book: YES. YES. YES. And again, YES. Britomart is amazing. (I just finished the final book, so my reviews will be shorter and less helpful.) \n Fourth book: I LOVED THIS BOOK. I'm not sure whether this or Book 3 is my favorite. Probably Book 3, but this one comes close. Britomart rescues her man. I love it (I think the mature thing is to look over what our culture now deems \"misogyny\" or \"patriarchy\" because no one getting mad at Spencer's morals are going to actually change his story or make it less fun). \n Fifth book: Eh, fine. Artegall is fine. I don't think he's worthy of Brits, but he'll do, I suppose. Even if he does have a metal man to do his dirty work. \n Sixth book: Eh. Okay. I liked the Arthur-and-Timias parts best, of course, because I have a huge soft spot for Timias and his love for Belphoebe (who was unfortunately missing). This one got really bogged down in lots of characters and interlaced situations. I just hope Artegall got back to Brits. \n Overall: I want to give this three stars and four at once. Three is probably more accurate for a mean score, but I'm still SO in love with Books 1/3/4 that I feel like a four-star rating is more true to my enthusiasm for what I do like. It's a difficult book and it's often not fun at all, even in my favorite books, and gosh knows I went to university summaries more often than not because I could not be bothered to disentangle plotlines for characters I didn't care about. \n But it's a classic for a reason. And I DO LOVE ME SOME BRITOMART AND BRITOMART/AMORET FRIENDSHIP. And Arthur/Timias, and Timias/Belphoebe. \n I want to write a few retellings. Some of these characters are just so alive!","date":"2016-01-14"}

That is, the value and knowledge of ones own death as well as the knowledge of suffering and tragedy being inevitable part of life. In the epos of Gilgamesh even the most perfect man has to come to terms with his own death. He does all he can, and that with tremendous strength to achieve infinite life, but in the end eternal life is stolen by that of a snake. He doesn't give up on life, but contemplates how death should be viewed, and understands that the only way one could live forever is within the stories of the people who come after you. In stories one might live forever, and knowing that one has helped make the world a place with a little bit less suffering might be enough to come to terms with the fact of ones own mortality. \n A great and necessary read for anybody interested in the history of societal values.","date":"2017-07-22"}

{"book_id":"402128","rating":3,"review_text":"Every time I see CATS: The Musical, I always think of poor old Maxwell Sheffield from The Nanny. For those of you who didn't spend half their childhood watching Fran and her folk - the ongoing storyline was that Mr. Sheffield, in what was to become the poorest decision if his life, turned down the offer to produce CATS. Then, in a throw to reality, Sheffield's arch enemy, Andrew Lloyd Webber took on the project and consequently benefited from the uncanny success in which it has acquired. \n For anyone who has actually seen the musical, you could never actually fault him? It is in essence, cats singing about cats, whilst surrounded by rubbish. \n I digress. The point was supposed to be - the musical is WHACK. \n But, I do love it. \n Reading these poems was interesting, and I'll happily admit I couldn't help but read them to the tune of the songs. It also cemented the fact (that for me) the hype surrounding both the poetry and the musical is nothing short of completely bizzare. Mainly because I can't understand why it is so appealing to me and everyone else. \n I don't have a love of poetry at all, and I've never really understood the lack of a real plot in the musical, but after reading this the absolute lack of sense seems to make complete sense. \n If you know what I mean? \n I think my standard review of the musical also fits with this book.

{"book_id":"1381","rating":5,"review_text":"Homer's epic poem THE ODYSSEY is a twenty-four book work that has been considered won of the great written works since its birth in the 8th century. As the dictionary describes it 'The Odyssey is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. It is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, the other work traditionally ascribed to Homer. The poem is fundamental to the modern Western canon. Indeed it is the second--the Iliad being the first--extant work of Western literature. It was probably composed near the end of the 8th century BC, somewhere in Ionia, the Greek-speaking coastal region of what is now Turkey.' This fascinating tale, so important to our understanding of the great works of literature, can be a challenge to read - not so much for the story line (confusing though that may be due to the several names attributed to each character in the work) as to the style of writing: ennui can set in heavily after a few pages of wading through the first book. Fro example, a usual translation of from the Greek may read: 'Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.' What Wayne Josephson has done in continuing his Readable Classics is extract the story, brushed off the filigree and keeps the momentum flowing as in the variation of the same opening: \"Tell me, muse, about that resourceful hero Odysseus, who was forced to wander far and wide after he destroyed the famous city of Troy. He saw many cities and became acquainted with their ways. He suffered greatly at sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home. But hard as he tried, he could not save them. They foolishly ate the cattle of the Sun god Hyperion, who then made certain they would never reach home, and so they died. Tell us this story, goddess, daughter of Zeus, one more time.' Does the flavor of the tale change or does it seem like Josephson has buffed off important facts? No, but instead what we have is the story in contemporary English that flows so smoothly that it invites us to complete the novel. That is the pleasure of reading the many books Wayne Josephson has 'cleaned' for us: Emma, Jane Eyre, The Scarlet Letter, Moby Dick, Pride and Prejudice, Emma and the Vampires (Josephson's own hilarious takeoff on Austen's inimitable Emma character!), and now The Odyssey. This is a major contribution to the art of reading that hopefully will restore these great books to the shelves of young people eager for great stories. Another Bravo!

{"book_id":"1420","rating":3,"review_text":"\"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\" \n Hamlet by William Shakespeare. \n If you have ever taken an AP or college literature course, then you know Shakespeare. Written by one of the most famous playwrights in all of history, Hamlet is a staple of tragedy. \n (Note: Hamlet's father is also named Hamlet.) \n This is a play about Hamlet, the prince of Denmark, and the quest the ghost of his father, the late king, sends him on to take revenge for his death. Unoriginally his father's spirit claims that his brother, Claudius who inherited the throne, is responsible for his death. To make it even sweeter, Claudius decided to marry the late King Hamlet's wife, Queen Gertrude. Hamlet agrees, but stalls eventually driving him mad. This causes Claudius and Gertrude to become suspicious and try to figure out what is going on with Hamlet. To find this out for them, the King and Queen enlist two of Hamlet's friends to spy on him. To thicken this soup of a disaster, Polonius convinces everybody that Hamlet is in love with his daughter, Ophelia. This is not true. At all. He evens commands her to go to a convent. After a trap with actors, Claudius proves his guilt, but right before Hamlet kills him he finds him in prayer. Uncertain, Hamlet backs off and decides to wait. By this time Claudius has become fearful of Hamlet and orders him away. \n And here is where it all goes down... \n During a paranoid outburst, he ends up killing Polonius and does, in fact, get sent to England. Out of grief, Ophelia drowns herself. *Spoiler Alert: During all this, we learn that Hamlet actually did love Ophelia.* Claudius orders the King of England to put Hamlet to death. That doesn't happen and Hamlet returns to Denmark. Claudius comes up with the idea to make Hamlet fence with Laertes, who has a poisoned sword. As back up if Hamlet wins, he will be offered a poisoned goblet. Well, Hamlet wins and refuses to drink from the cup. BUT Gertrude does drink from it! Turns out the King killed his own Queen. THEN Laertes gets cut from his own blade and dies from the poison. This reveals that Claudius is responsible for Gertrude's death, so Hamlet stabs Claudius! Hamlet then dies from the poison of the sword he was cut with earlier. \n Total Death Count: 8 \n (This includes King Hamlet killed by Claudius and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who were killed by the King of England. Hamlet was SUPER SLY because he gave the King the note that said to kill HIM. The thing was that the note actually said to kill those brought to him (the King). This, in turn, led the king to believe the note meant the two people who accompanied Hamlet.) \n The story concludes with Fortinbras, a Norwegian prince, finding all of the royalty dead. He ends up taking over the kingdom and has Hamlet buried with the honors of a soldier. The end. \n I didn't mention Horatio, but he is Hamlet's faithful friend who ends up telling his story. \n Overall, this is one of Shakespeare's better writings in my opinion. I am not a giant fan of him, even though that is pretty taboo in the lit world. My favorite work of his is Macbeth. If you haven't read it, do. I live by WWLMD (What would Lady Macbeth do?). She is seriously bad ass. \n I think it is important to note that the element of love here is not very romantic, but more familial. Hamlet goes through all of this out of love for his father and trying to get him his revenge. He ends up killing Claudius out of love for his mother, Gertrude. Ophelia drowns out of grief for her father, Polonius. Family is what drives this tragedy. \n ORIGINALLY POSTED ON www.literaturedreams.com","date":"2017-09-12"}

{"book_id":"58098","rating":5,"review_text":"My thoughts about this are probably not as complex as they could be, so I am a little hesitant to post a review already. I feel like I probably would have gotten more out of this had I watched the performance because I KNOW I kept getting the women mixed up. I had to jump back to previous poems/scenes multiple times to remind myself of various lines and incidents, but even so I know I mixed a few up accidentally. Each woman is from a different city and wears a different color, so they're known as Lady in Red, Lady in Brown, Lady in Green, etc. Together they make a dramatic rainbow. \n My favorite poem was \"Toussaint,\" though I'm not sure I can say why. Maybe because of the innocence and honesty paired with the forward-moving story? Or maybe because it wasn't as depressing as some of the others? Or maybe because there is sort of a happy ending to that segment? Or maybe because she, like me, loved reading books? \n My biggest complaint with it is less a complaint about the book and more a complaint about reality. The book involves subjects like domestic abuse, rape, abortion, racism, and much more. And the women are all oppressed by people and/or society in one way or another. But they all define themselves by the men in their lives. It's hard (almost impossible) to see them on their own. That was frustrating to me. But I know that's kind of the point. That's the way the world is. Still, I wish I had been able to see the women on their own to really get a sense of their character rather than their broken, abused forms. But that's probably the whole point, right? Society doesn't let them stand strong on their own. But it should. Because these women are definitely strong to make it through all this hell. And they deserve to realize it by the end.","date":"2017-05-07"}

{"book_id":"1371","rating":5,"review_text":"Western literature kicks off with the clash of civilizations. \n Crafting an epic of my own, I got the idea of exploring the great epics of Western literature in more detail. They are all to be found in my set of the Britannica Great Books of the Western World: \n - the Iliad (volume 4, Homer) \n - the Odyssey (volume 4, Homer) \n - the Aeneid (volume 13, Virgil) \n - The Divine Comedy (volume 21, Dante) \n - Paradise Lost (volume 32, Milton) \n However, I read not the Great Books version, a prose translation by Samuel Butler, but rather the verse translation by Robert Fagles, published in a lovely paperback by Penguin Classics in 1998. I bought it in January 2008 along with a companion edition of the Odyssey, also translated by Fagles, when I saw them together in a bookstore. I probably read it not long after I bought it, and that was my first time through the whole work (I had attempted a prose translation by W.H.D. Rouse when I was in grade 10, but abandoned it before I got too far). So this time through marked my second reading of the famous poem. \n It took me 2 months to read. My method, as with reading any poetry, was to read it aloud. But, more than that, I also wanted to record the story of the Iliad, its actual episodes; so I also wrote my own prose summary of the action as I went along, noting down each episode after I'd read it. Each morning I would type the handwritten notes into a Word document. So now I have my own summary of Homer's poem, based on my 60 pages of notes. That will help me when I want to refresh my memory as to the actual story of the poem, and if, as I hope to do, I engage in any analysis of the story. The process of writing down the episodes also had the effect of causing me to pay closer attention to what I was reading, for as I wrote my notes I would have to go back and check to make sure I was getting things right, and the action of typing them the following morning further consolidated my acquaintance with the events of the story. \n And what is that story? In brief, it's the story announced by the title of book 1: \"The Rage of Achilles.\" The opening word of the poem is rage, and the massive poem, about 540 pages, derives its unity from following the emotional journey of Achilles, the Greeks' (or the Achaeans', as they're mostly known in this work) best warrior. Achilles' nose is put out of joint early on when the expedition commander, Agamemnon, pulls rank on him and seizes certain spoils of war that Achilles had claimed for himself, in particular a beautiful woman named Briseis. Achilles throws an immense snit and retreats to his own compound to brood. Now, no matter how badly things go for his fellow soldiers, nothing will draw him back into the fray. Only the prospect of restoring his damaged dignity can possibly rouse him. Until then, he and his men, the Myrmidons, sit out the fight, idling by their beached ships while their countrymen fight and die on the plain outside Troy. He has his dear friend Patroclus to pass his days with and help him nurse his wounded ego. \n Meanwhile the Achaeans are in tough fighting the Trojans, who are led by their own top warrior, Hector, the most beloved son of King Priam. And Hector is proving to be a handful for the Achaeans, who number among them such formidable fighters as Odysseus, the brothers Ajax, Diomedes, and the dead-eye archer Teucer. Again and again we witness the vicissitudes of battle, as soldiers filled with fighting fury press the attack, only to have things turn against them and send them scrambling in terror for their lives. \n In large part this is because the fortunes of war are not up to men alone. Homer shows us how it is the active involvement of the gods that is the decisive factor. The original cause of the war is alluded to but never explicitly discussed by Homer: Priam's son Paris, ordered to choose which of 3 goddesses was the most beautiful--Hera, Athena, or Aphrodite--chose Aphrodite because she promised to give him the world's most beautiful woman. That woman was Helen, who happened to be the wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. Paris made off with Helen and a shipload of treasure from Sparta, and Menelaus did not take this affront lying down: he assembled a coalition to launch an expedition against Troy to recover Helen and to punish the Trojans. When Paris chose Aphrodite, he made enemies of Hera and Athena, and those gods with whom they were connected or allied. Aphrodite, naturally enough, took Paris's part in the dispute. It turns out that the 2 sides have roughly equal divine backing, with Hera, Athena, Poseidon, Hermes, and Hephaestus helping the Achaeans, and Aphrodite, Apollo, Ares, Artemis, Leto, and the River Xanthus helping the Trojans. Zeus, father and king of the gods, does not formally take sides, but his heart is with the Trojans, who have long offered him superb sacrifices. His private residence is on Mount Ida, near Troy. Although Zeus does not take part in the actual fighting, he is called upon to intervene in one way or another at various points. In particular, the war down below is echoed in his own marriage with Hera; with them we witness a divine marriage in trouble, and have to wonder whether immortality and wedlock are meant to coexist. \n I started off by mentioning the clash of civilizations; it seems significant that Troy is in Asia (not far from modern Istanbul). For while the Trojans are portrayed as speaking the same language and paying worship to the same gods as the Achaeans, they are also presented as an alien culture. For while the Achaeans all come from cities in their own lands, theirs is a warrior culture: the status of its men is built up almost entirely around prowess in battle. And while they appreciate and enjoy wealth, it is always portrayed as won in combat or in competitive games, or perhaps received as gifts of friendship. In contrast, Troy is depicted as a wealthy city, but one whose wealth has been earned through trade. Warriors have always despised trade, and indeed the definition of a nobleman in Europe has been, from earliest times, one who makes his living by the profession of arms. Tradesmen produce wealth, warriors seize it from them; their relationship is that of predator and prey. For a warrior to turn into a tradesman would be like a wolf turning into a sheep--a humiliating transformation. \n The Asians are thus seen here as effete and inferior. Indeed, Paris's act of absconding with Helen and other of Menelaus's possessions was a perfidious crime motivated by the unseemly passion of lust. His behavior is degenerate, perverse, and, well, unmanly. It was . . . Asian. \n And yet Troy is civilized. Hector, while the greatest warrior among the Trojans, is also portrayed as a family man who treats his wife and son with tenderness, and who also, almost alone among his countrymen, shows kindness and compassion to Helen. There is a sense here of a rich, cultured society, one that this reader would have liked to glimpse more of, while the Achaeans remain mostly blustering alpha males, thin skinned and jealous of their honor. \n The role of fate in the story is subtle and complex. Both men and gods seem to feel somewhat oppressed by fate, when they're aware of it, but at the same time they are worried about doing things that go against fate or violate it. It leads one to wonder what fate is exactly, or anyway what Homer's conception of it is. Achilles, for instance, knows that he's fated to have a short but glorious career. No doubt this knowledge contributes to his sense of outrage when Agamemnon takes his trophies from him. Even Zeus worries about the designs of fate being upset, and takes action to prevent that from happening, even as he also sometimes muses about allowing it to happen. \n In all, I enjoyed this second reading of the poem very much. I became more familiar with the large cast of characters, getting past the \"blizzard of names\" problem. I tried not to rush. I find that I am always conscious of how many books there are to read, even how many Great Books, and this consciousness creates a subtle pressure to try to tick off the items on my reading list, and thus reduces my involvement with the works. I'm like a tourist with an itinerary, more concerned with checking off \"Louvre\" and \"Notre Dame\" than with appreciating them for what they are. Hence my 2-month sojourn with the Iliad. \n I haven't talked about some of the things I really wanted to talk about, such as Homer's unflinching and harrowing depictions of battle. Homer tells you where the spear went in, what organs it pierced, and depicts the dismay and agony of the dying man as darkness covers his eyes and he flies away to the House of Death. There is a strange conjunction of nonsensicalness and inevitability hanging over the battlefield. And I wanted to mention that the Iliad is not an account of the whole Trojan War, but just a turning point that occurs over a very few days. It really is just about the rage of Achilles. \n If you haven't read the Iliad, then I want to say that it's more approachable that you might think, certainly in this translation. It's a real story, told by a real storyteller, one celebrated as among the greatest of all time. Bernard Knox's introduction is fantastic and not to be missed. He helps get your mind into the right frame to get the most out of Homer's first epic. \n OK. Next: the Odyssey.","date":"2017-06-02"}

Although I initially found the plot line repetitive, through study, I have come to appreciate its surprisingly dialectic moral dimension and metaphoric use of the mythological trial and have definitely enjoyed reading into this a philosophical sense of religious conflict and have a particular appetite for perceiving the Being debate subtly waged within concerning a more humanist plasticity and perhaps a more Christian essentialism.

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":5,"review_text":"This is a beautifully written memoir set in poetry by the much acclaimed author Jacqueline Woodson. Jacqueline's aunt Ada, a genealogist and family historian, provided Jacqueline with tremendous family history with which this book begins that adds depth and history to the memoir. There is always a contrast between the north an south running like a current through this book. Jacqueline and her family begin in Ohio visiting South Carolina in the summer. They ultimately begin alternating between Brooklyn and South Carolina. \n Jacqueline Woodson is so eloquent in ascribing the haziness of memory and how feelings and emotions at the time become the more important element. The poetic format for placing these snippets of memory seems so honest and heartfelt. \n This is a small volume, yet contains so much. There is so much history, especially regarding the Civil Rights Movement, written into these pages. There is the effect of teachers on a young girl's self-confidence when they praise her writing. There is the love of a family; the complete trust and vulnerability of young children knowing that they are safe with family they love. There is the beauty of forever friendships, these early friendships that are so important and make life so much more enjoyable. This is a book about race, about growing up as a Jehovah's witness, about dreams in childhood that have so wonderfully come to fruition for Jacqueline Woodson. \n This book has been marketed as middle grade, but I would recommend it to everyone. It is a remarkably beautiful collection of poetry, rich in history. I think it is so hard to write from a child's perspective and honestly capture the thoughts and perspective from that time in life, but Jacqueline Woodson does so brilliantly. I love how within this book, Jacqueline talks about how she does not read quickly like her sister. She takes her time with books, reading, thinking, re-reading, enjoying. This, I believe, is how one should read Brown Girl Dreaming, There is so much to take away and enjoy from each chapter/poem. \n I loved this book for being a beautiful heartfelt collection of poetry, for moving me in ways I did not expect to be moved, for giving young girls hope and reason to dream, for beautifully describing family, and so much more. Beyond that, I also appreciate that this adds to the growing body of diverse literature, especially for young people. \n For discussion questions, please see: http://www.book-chatter.com/?p=2166.","date":"2017-07-10"}

It was amazing to me how much emotion, feeling and wisdom could be contained in so few words. There is so much empowerment contained within this collection: of women, femininity, and race. While reading this, I wanted to be absolutely alone with the book without fear of interruption, so I could fully focus, digest and enjoy these poems. The poem above is featured on the back of the book and is a brief synopsis of the book. \n The poetry in this collection is divided into 4 segments. The first labelled \"the hurting\" touches on topics of rape, sexual abuse, and abusive parenting. It describes feelings of emptiness and suppression, however, also the ability to transcend the hurt with kindness. It describes the fractured relationship left as a result of abuse. \"The loving\" portion is about hope, qualities of a lover, love making, women's bodies and sex. \"The breaking\" is about heartbreak, games young lovers play, the bitter aspects of relationships, and relationships that break you down or want you to be someone you aren't. Rupi Kaur speaks of intense extremes of feelings and emotions. Finally, \"the healing\" is about loving yourself, the strength within oneself, being contented with being alone. It is about loving one's own female body in it's most natural form and all of the way it functions. It's about the power of vulnerability, openness and kindness. It's about celebrating and supporting other women's successes rather than their failures. It is about celebrating feminine beauty in all its different colors, shapes and sizes. \n Beautiful, kind, loving! The sketches throughout this book are perfect and add to the poetry, almost seeming to be poetry in and of themselves. I highly recommend this to every woman, especially the late teen and twenty-something set. I recommend buying the actual book, to enjoy the words, the sketches and probable re-readings. \n Rupi Kaur is a Canadian who has created a lot of attention for herself through the use of social media (#poetryisnotdead). She was born in Punjab, India and moved to Canada at the age of 4. Not speaking any English, she was inspired by her mother to draw and paint. In 2014, Kaur self published \"milk and honey,\" however it was so popular that a publishing company picked it up and republished it in 2015. Kaur posted a picture on Instagram in March 2015 of herself in bed with a menstrual stain on her sweatpants as part of a project aimed at destigmatizing menstruation.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"I read this in an hour, but I am still shocked at the beauty and how much it influences my thoughts. Her poetry primarily about women: how the world treats us and how to heal from misogyny ingrained into our society. However, underlying all of this is the theme of refugees, immigration, and embracing cultures different than our own. Through the pain that Kaur writes, we learn the importance of love, strength, and healing. \n The people who criticize her work and it's Tumblr status fail to recognize why Kaur writes how she does. The minimalist design, with no capitalization and only periods for punctuation, is not only aesthetically beautiful, but has a purpose: Kaur's mother tongue, Gurmukhi, is written the same way. The stories embracing femininity are not feminism gone wild: they are how we heal after we have been broken. Her poetry is what poetry should be: symbolic, layered, meaningful, and influential. \n This book is a treat you can savor again and again.","date":"2016-12-22"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"First and foremost, I am a poet as well as a writer. (I know there are some that like making that distinction when in reality a poet is a writer, whereas a writer is not always a poet.) Having written, workshopped and read many poems along with taken multiple poetry classes, I can assure you that I hold some merit but am no expert nor claim to be one. \n This book of poetry is unique because it integrates the written word with drawings that only enhance a reader's experience with the text. Rupi Kaur's book of poetry targets themes that I am most passionate about and hold dear to my heart: love, loss, trauma, abuse, healing, and femininity. I found myself pausing at various pages just so I can start at the top of the page or the beginning section of the poem just to reread what I read because it awakened a feeling of reassurance and evoked an element of empathy that I am always looking for in everything I read (poems and prose alike). \n i do not want to have you \n to fill the empty parts of me \n i want to be full on my own \n i want to be so complete \n i could light a whole city \n and then \n i want to have you \n cause the two of us combined \n could set it on fire \n (Kaur 59) \n Kaur's writing is so direct, yet filled with milk and honey language that softens the blow of truth that stings when it hits your face. There are even moments of one liners that seem so simple, yet it's the simplicity that sometimes we need to hear (or in this case read or speak aloud) that awakens a resurgence in the brain: \n loneliness is a sign you are in desperate need of yourself \n (Kaur 153) \n Aside from the many positives of this novel, I did see moments where I felt Kaur either told too much or feigned away from imagery and relied on \"telling\" rather than \"showing.\" For example: \n i am losing parts of you like i lose eyelashes \n unknowingly and everywhere \n (Kaur 135) \n I feel that the lines above is over-explaining the idea of losing someone like eyelashes when really it can be implied by the reader. I am only noticing this because I suffer from over-explaining in my own poetry and have been told many times that I must trust the reader and allow them to interpret what I mean because once a poem is published \"it's no longer yours\" (as said by a previous poetry professor of mine). At some level I agree and on another I disagree, but that is neither here nor there. \n Overall, I recommend this book of poetry to all that find beauty in poetry and feminism. Although I am not female, I relate to many female woe's. The notion of needing to be \"hairless\" is relevant strongly for women, but it is also very relevant within the homosexual atmosphere as I have been asked time and time again, I like hairless men. Are you smooth (implying that area around my penis and ass crack are completely shaven)? I find the idea of one needing to be hairless as what I call a \"self-want-need,\" not a want or need that should be pushed onto a person because of their sexuality or gender, but only because a person has a personal want or need to be hairless. Personally, I don't like my body being completely hairless all the time, but I like always being trimmed. I and I alone should make this decision because that is how I like my body to be. I would never force this upon another individual because that is not my body, nor is it a body for me to control. The ability for women and men to question and obliterate societal prejudices including sexism, gender discrimination, racism, ableism, et cetera is what I am the most passionate about and Kaur does an excellent job at bringing some of these topics out within her poems.","date":"2016-06-15"}

{"book_id":"2547","rating":1,"review_text":"The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is about a man who lived in a foreign city of Orphalese for 12 years and is about to embark on a ship and return to his birthplace, when he is stopped by the people with whom he discusses 26 different topics about life. \n Prose Poetry. Beautiful wordplay. Philosophical, lyrical. Some lines are great - specially the chapters on Love, Marriage, Children and Law. Quotes are meant to be insightful and thought-provoking. \n But as Gibran says: \"You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts.\" He talks ceaselessly indeed! I will offend many people but it isn't my intention. As a whole, the book is almost like the work of a plagiarist. His philosophy is presented by this man giving a sermon on the Mount. The guy is Prophet Al Mustafa. He stands there addressing a group about do's and don'ts of life. That in itself, is ditto copy of the story of Islam and Prophet Muhammad addressing his people! Like how Jesus addressed his people. The language used, the philosophies written were so definitely inspired by the Bible & Quran. Upon googling Gibran, voila! He was a Christian who was deeply inspired by Islam. What was offensive in his writing was how he had lusty, seductive undertones. His nude artwork strewn about in the book were just nonsensical & definitely unnecessary. \n The quotes are individually nice to read but as a whole, it doesn't tell us anything that we don't already know about how to live life. There is no surprise why it appealed to many coz they don't really read their own spiritual texts and they easily get inspired by this unoriginal and \"borrowed\" inspiration. It's a one-sided conversation throughout the book. Who is this man? Where was he for 12 yrs? Right when he is about to leave, his people want to hear him? And oh boy, what a crash-course on life he gives! \n As someone on Goodreads commented: \"This is basically an older, less-readable incarnation of that other pseudo-mystic Paulo Coelho. Both men are charlatans.\" So true! Paulo and Gibran - same style, same philosophical nonsense. \n I don't feel enlightened or inspired, or changed in any way reading this book. But it's a really short book thankfully and has some great quotes such as below: \n \"Let there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you. Love one another but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.\" \n -- Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet","date":"2016-08-20"}

{"book_id":"1381","rating":5,"review_text":"\"Our lives are lived by powers we pretend to understand.\" -Auden \n Homer's second epic poem after the Iliad has always been touted as a metaphor for the journey of life, the dangers we must avoid, the fights we must confront, the duties we must fulfill. \n For me, Homer, 2700 years ago, wrote down everything you need to know about human nature and what passes for \"life\". The Iliad and The Odyssey observe it all in detail. \n Rather than some heroic tale, for me, the Odyssey is a book about boys (called MEN in the poem), \n boys who after massacring, pillaging, raping the vanquished Troy to their hearts' content, leave and continue to do exactly the same on their way home. Pissing off the gods (\"boys will be boys\"), their journey of mayhem is extended for 10 years. These lord of the flies boys are led by Odysseus, whose hubris and big mouth keep getting them into trouble with the gods and condemn each and every one of them (except Odysseus) to death. \n Homer unflinchingly depicts a culture that encourages and glorifies boys staying boys, never growing up; it condones their blood lust and temper tantrums as \"manly\". Honestly, nothing has changed. \n There is nothing \"heroic\" about these \"men\". They are brutes. Our modern culture still glorifies these behaviors, which makes The Odyssey as relevant as ever. At least it is better written and more beautiful to read than the news. Men's behavior is just as predictable, violent and boring but Homer's words are luxurious, so enjoyable as you yawn through the predictability of testosterone run rampant.","date":"2017-08-08"}

{"book_id":"18263725","rating":4,"review_text":"Crossover is a fun read that can be enjoyed by sports fans and reluctant readers. This novel in verse is the story of Josh and Jordan (JB), identical twin sons of former basketball phenom Chuck \"Da Man\" Bell, are ball legends themselves, and they aren't yet thirteen. Josh is the only kid in his school who can dunk, while JB has a mean three-point shot, and together they're a well-oiled machine on the court. Josh and Jordan's relationship begins to change as JB gets a girlfriend and Josh loses his brother and friend, Their relationship is strained to the point of a mid-game altercation that lands Josh on the bench for weeks. In addition to not playing ball, there is the constant worry Josh has for his Dad's poor health. \n Some readers tend to shy away from novel in verse books, but Alexander takes this fear away as the words on the page come alive. The exciting play-by-play game details makes you feel as if you are sitting in the stands at Josh's school cheering him and his brother on the court. There is also some insightful middle-school observations, and poignant portrayals of sibling dynamics and familial love. The words move on their own as the wordplay and alliteration roll out like hip-hop lyrics, and the use of concrete forms and playful font changes keep things dynamic. This is a quick read that I think many readers will enjoy.","date":"2016-02-01"}

And that is in no way an invalidation of Rupi Kaur's expression and feelings, I applaud her for having the courage to express her feelings in a way she felt comfortable doing so, she was so honest and didn't sugarcoat the important topics she was tackling, and she shared them with the world around her. I am as well so happy that this book made people talk about those topics and explore the art of poetry more. \n Criticising this felt like me criticising a personal diary, criticising the way someone felt.. Because isn't this like Rupi's diary? Doesn't her poetry express her feelings and experiences? How can I criticise that? \n But I won't go with the flow when the current is trying to drift me away from my place, I am sorry to say that it didn't work out for me. \n ----- \n UPDATE: I have been thinking about this book quite a lot, feeling like I misjudged it.

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":4,"review_text":"Randi Bennett, Response #8 \n Brown Girl Dreaming is Jacqueline Woodson's memoir. While many people would have continued that sentence by saying \"about growing up during the Civil Rights Movement,\" I chose to end it at memoir. Brown Girl Dreaming is absolutely an account about Jacqueline Woodson's experience being \"brown\", but it is also an account of her family, her religion, her friends, and her aspirations. Woodson's book of verse takes us through her life with her Mother, three siblings, and grandparents as she moves from Ohio to South Carolina to New York. Woodson discusses everything from the experience of having to get on the bus late at night to avoid whites who were angry with the Civil Rights movement, having to avoid certain stores in South Carolina, to what it was like walking around door to door trying to convert people for the Jehovah Witnesses or sharing food with her best friend on the front porch of her home in New York. It is a dynamic story about the different facets of Jacqueline's life, and explores universal themes such as love, loss, and the desire to understand your place in the world around you. \n A lot of people in our class didn't connect with this book, and I think that's because they read it at face value. I heard a lot about not being able to connect or understand the struggle she was going through, because we will never understand what it's like to be \"a brown girl in the 1960s.\" I know I will never understand that experience, but I can sympathize with it. Jacqueline Woodson's writing was beautiful and eloquent. It was told from the perspective or a child who was aching to understand why the world didn't want to love each other, and that is something that we are still struggling with in this world today. In addition to that, she touched on other universal themes such as loss and family, and I found that I could really empathize with those poems. Overall, Woodson made me want to keep reading. Not my favorite book of verse, but I did appreciate the way the poems flowed together, and I loved the meaning behind them all when they connected together.","date":"2016-03-02"}

Don't get me wrong I like beautiful writing, but sometimes with more traditional poetry I don't always grasp the metaphors and point the author is trying to make. I loved how raw this was, it was short, to the point, and honest, and beautiful because of that. This is definitely a book I will reread throughout my life. My favorite part I think was \"the healing.\" I think it's helpful to read no matter what. Even if you haven't gone through the things this book is about, you can still relate to something. For me, it helped with a long time friendship split. It also helped me as a woman, to feel strong, and reinforces the idea of work on yourself for yourself. The illustrations were powerful, and beautiful. I read this in one sitting, I would recommend. :)","date":"2017-01-30"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"I read--and reread--this poetry collection over the course of three days. I really, really wanted to like it. I'd heard many great things about it. I should also add that just three or four weeks ago, I read Salt and Nejma by Nayyirah Waheed and Bone by Yrsa Daley-Ward. Kaur says that each of the collection's chapters deals with love, loss, trauma, abuse, healing and femininity. This is true, but, on the whole, I would say that the majority of the poems are about heartbreak and overcoming the death of a relationship. As other reviewers have stated, Kaur writes in the style of Waheed and Warsan Shire. However, to quote another reviewer, Kaur's language \"lacks the sensuousness, voluptuousness, and potency\" of the aforementioned poets. I was deeply disappointed. There are some gems scattered throughout the work, but I found each of the four chapters underwhelming. I kept waiting for the incredible sense of emotion that fills me every time I read Waheed, Shire, or Daley-Ward. It never came. I think that Kaur will find her own voice and rhythm as she continues to write. Additionally, it would be completely unfair of me to fail to mention that this is a visual poetry collection. The best (and most original) aspect of Milk and Honey is that you can read the images in conjunction with (and apart from) the written language. \n If you are a huge fan of Waheed and Shire, I would recommend skipping this collection. The desire to compare will be strong, and Kaur's work will fall short every time.","date":"2016-03-13"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"Poetry shouldn't need doodles, or weird line breaks, or formatting tricks to make it linguistically attractive. \n The words are supposed to be able to stand and shine on their own. \n One of the reasons I found Milk and Honey problematic, despite its commendable message, is that many of Kaur's \"poems\" aren't well, poetry. Although there were a few unique phrases and hidden gems, the book held too many cliches and overused phrases and ultimately lost its meaning. \n I get it. Relatable sells. But at some point someone \"whispering I love you\" for the umpteenth time crosses the boundary between raw emotion and an Instagram caption. \n I wish Kaur had explored more depth, more bitterness, more feeling. Instead, the words were generic and underwhelming. While her words ring true, they lacked nuance. \n Milk and Honey gets three stars because the power and following Kaur has reached with it is still impressive. She was able to share something that resonated with people and break boundaries as a woman of color. Regardless of how good a poem is, the impact of that piece of work is what makes it important. \n But, the book isn't poetry. Milk and Honey is a book of diary entries.","date":"2017-07-20"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"\"i am a museum full of art \n but you had your eyes shut\" \n One of the most beautiful poetry books that I have ever read. \n This small black book contained beautifully arranged words that were filled with so much hurt, empowerment, and self love. \n I love how it spoke to me as a woman. I love how it celebrated the fact that females are strong, that we as a gender, were more than what we were constantly shown and told to be. That we are beautiful no matter what the beauty standards were. Better yet, screw those standards. \n I can clearly see that Kaur had battled discrimination as well, and suffered from daddy issues. She spoke about it vividly through her poetry, but one can clearly see that it was from a personal experience. I liked how realistic it was. It felt genuine. \n She revealed to us her pain with no shame, and we as readers welcomed it. This just shows how brave Rupi is to share such personal things with her readers around the world. \n I was honestly touched, and drenched my copy with highlighters because her words deserved to shine. I seriously like the fact that she spoke about love, but it wasn't only the romantic aspect of it that she focused on. \n Her message was clear, and I happily received it. I even have a favorite piece in the book, which happens to be very long (typical me) but here is a glimpse of it: \n i am not a hotel room. i am home \n i am not the whiskey you want \n i am the water you need \n don't come here with expectations \n and try to make a vacation out of me \n Just brilliant. \n I would highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates poetry and supports women empowerment.

There's no denying that there is a lot to be liked in Milk and Honey, and the criticism that I've heard a couple of times of the poetry being \"too accessible\" is some seriously snobby garbage that I'm not interested in. With things like this, if you get something out of it, then it has value. I really enjoyed 3/4 of this book, the segments The Hurting, The Loving, and The Breaking really worked for me, and are filled with genuinely emotionally effective piece of writing. For me, where it falls down is in The Healing. I'm not suggesting that the pieces there weren't in someway therapeutic or some may find value, but the issue that I have is that this section of the book falls back on some tired cliches, and the emotional impact started to wane a little bit for me. \n I very much enjoyed a huge number of these poems, and do strongly recommend the book.

{"book_id":"1381","rating":5,"review_text":"One of the two sacred books of the Greeks, along with The Illiad. Fantastic book(s), no doubt about that. The only question remaining is which one of the two i liked best- and i do not have an unshakeably decided answer. Different in style to some extent from one another, the books stand moreover for different aspects of life as well: war and adventure, none void of violence nonetheless. Many would say that war includes adventure, or that they are inextricable, but they are in truth distinct, despite the possible sporadic simmilarities- particularly in Homer's work. War is tightly bound to the idea of death and heroic deeds whereas adventure implies the supernatural, fabulous beings and the interference of the gods (more, more often and more clearly). The fact is that The Odyssey is closer to a fairy tale whilst the Iliad presents itself more like a war-chronicle-excerpt. \n While i could even admit that Odysseus' way home makes a greater story, Achille's dilemma- go home a never-known nobody or stay and die enwrapped in a fame that shall last for the ages - and him, as the protagonist, makes me stagger and forces me into going with the Iliad and that's it. Ulisses, my friend, no hard feelings dude. Second place is also a winner. \n That being said, I strongly recommend picking up these two godlike writings- two pillars of the western culture.","date":"2016-06-20"}

{"book_id":"15997","rating":3,"review_text":".... If then his Providence \n Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, \n Our labor must be to pervert that end, \n And out of good still to find means of evil;- (I. 162-165). \n So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay \n Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence \n Has ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will \n And high permission of all-ruling Heaven \n Left him at large to his own dark designs, \n That with reiterated crimes he might \n Heap on himself damnation, while he sought \n Evil to others, and enrag'd might see \n How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth \n Infinite goodness, grace and mercy show \n On Man by him, seduc't, but on himself \n Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd- (I. 209-220) \n Milton's personification of Satan reminds me of old greek myth: Atlas. The man who was made to suffer, to hold up the sky, so that humanity could live. Satan, here, is a victim, but a necessity; a literal necessary evil. God gave humans free will, and if Satan and his crew weren't going around causing trouble (temptation), than obedience and faith would mean nothing. Milton portrays Satan with emotions, which is highly unorthodox, but, to me, feels most plausible. It distances God from his creations, and strengthens His power. There is a huge debate about whether or not Milton is portraying Satan as the protagonist, but I don't think he is. I also don't think he's portraying him as an antagonist, either. At the end, yes. Satan is evil. But I feel as if a majority of the work victimisies him, and shows him in a very relatable light-- who wouldn't be mad if their father, who is the Father, btw, damned them? He's snarky, and almost juvenile in the face of his retaliation, and goes through a psychological fall that is as, if not more so, traumatizing as the physical one. \n Note: My class only read books I, II, IV, IX, and X.","date":"2017-02-02"}
{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"Originally posted on: The Quirky Book Nerd \n Milk and Honey is a collection that has me finding difficulty in pinpointing my feelings about it. I think part of this is due to the hype surrounding this collection--it didn't quite live up to my expectations based on reviews I had seen floating about. However, it was far from disappointing at the same time, leaving me feeling a bit lukewarm about it as a whole. These poems started out very strong and immediately captivated me. Kaur's writing style was beautiful and poignant, and she displayed quite a bit of candor throughout. I definitely felt the most connection to and impact from the opening sections. \n However, the strong start did not last until the end of the work. For me, I began to like each part less and less, and this caused me to become quite detached from the poems by the end of the collection. I think this is where I began to feel a decrease in the fluidity of the writing as well--some parts came across as a bit jumbled and choppy. Though her intended message retained its power, the disjointedness was a bit off-putting. Nevertheless, I can see why Kaur's writing has touched so many people's lives. \n These poems display a lot of bravery and boldness--they unflinchingly tackle tough yet important topics. Journeying deep into the core of humanity, Kaur delves into dark topics in a very heartfelt way. Though it fell a little bit flat for me in the end, I truly do appreciate the beauty in her words and the impact of the messages she is conveying to the reader. Overall, I would definitely recommend giving this collection a try, and see if and how it speaks to you.","date":"2017-07-22"}

{"book_id":"15997","rating":3,"review_text":"I'm conflicted. \n On the one hand, it's obvious why this is a monumental piece of English literature. In fact, even writing this review feels wrong: Paradise Lost is Paradise Lost. It's shaped so much of English and Christian culture that it's hard not to praise it. It's where we get words like \"pandemonium,\" it's got some really incredible arguments, its imagery can be mind-blowing at times (Sin's evil dog-snake-vagina is incredible - and yes, I recognize the misogyny, oh, boy, do I recognize the misogyny, but more on that later), and it contains some unforgettable lines (\"which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell.\" DAMN.) \n And yet, and yet. So much of this poem doesn't sit right with me. I know it's my modern sensibilities. I know this book was written in \"a different time.\" But you know what? I like the values of my time better than Milton's values (which are not even representative of the values of his \"time\" as a whole). His depiction of Eve is so backwards that he manages to create one character who encapsulates both ends of the Madonna-whore complex. His misogyny doesn't end with Eve, either; Milton was sexist to the point that I couldn't help but feel sorry for his poor daughters as I read Paradise Lost. Some of Milton's assertions are really fucking pretentious, most notably his insistence that man shouldn't seek more knowledge than he is \"meant\" to have. Like, uh, Milton? You spend half of this book listing off obscure geographies and histories just to let us know how much more educated you are than anyone who's ever written before. You're evidently fine with showing off your own extensive knowledge. \n I with I hadn't spent half this poem awed by Milton and the other half wishing I could time travel back to 1667 so I could flip the grim bastard off. Actually, I think that wish perfectly exemplifies how ambivalent I feel about Paradise Lost: Milton was blind, so he wouldn't know I had ever flipped him off, but I would have the satisfaction, privately, of knowing that it happened.","date":"2016-04-17"}

{"book_id":"15997","rating":5,"review_text":"You can't read \"Paradise Lost\" and tell me you appreciate it for the novelty of the story - if you don't know the story already, you've lived under a rock. It's the mother of all stories, if you only follow the Christian canon - the fall of one particular angel, the creation of the world, Adam and his rib named Eve, the naughty rib listening to the snake and eating from the Tree of Knowledge, both of them receiving their punishment... yada yada yada, the lesson is: disobeying God brings your fall, so don't disobey God, kids. However, \"Paradise Lost\" has to be read for the writing itself, for the fact that a blind John Milton, also suffering from severe gout, dictated it over five years in blank verse to other people, who wrote it down for him, and that it came out as an epic poem of massive length and impossible convolutions, taking everything out of you as a reader. Especially as a non-native speaker, this has been a proof of strength for me, managing to finish it only with the dictionary open and a simplified version at hand, to compare with the original version I was plowing through. \n People haven't changed for thousands of years. The human fears are all the same - death, loss, suffering. Our emotions have been expressed the same, because we haven't changed the way we feel them since we've existed; rage still takes over us, pity still fills us like a warm, melancholic wave, happiness still lifts the black curtain from over our eyes. We are human, and a story about angels fighting each other and God speaking with us and Noah filling an Ark manages to emphasize that perfectly. \n If you have the patience (or the guts), \"Paradise Lost\" is a must-read in the bibliography of any reader who wants to expand his literary field and test themselves.","date":"2016-03-05"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"I really loved this book. I found so many of the poems really relatable. \n The sectioning worked beautifully to create a narrative through all of the poems. I felt like I was going through her life with her but at the same time, reflecting on the experiences I've had throughout my life and thinking about them in a different way. \n The first section, The Hurting, gave a lot of context to the early part of Kaur's life and I loved the commentary on familial relationships. \n The second section, The Loving, explored the nature of love, sex and relationships from so many different angles, both positive and negative. I really liked how she talked about different elements of loving someone. \n The third section, The Breaking, showed the rollercoaster of feelings you go through when breaking up with someone, all of the ways you fall apart and miss someone. It showed how you have good days and bad days and the following section worked with it so well. \n The final section, The Healing, had a dual thing going on. Rupi discussed her own healing process but also helps the reader heal from whatever they are going through and is a really uplifting section. \n Most of the poems were really punchy one-liners that had so much weight and meaning behind them. There were many that I want to just quote to people because I felt as if she put my feelings into a short sentence that could make someone understand. \n At first the lack of punctuation in this book really annoyed me but then I really grew to love it. It creates this rough, raw, realness within her writing that made me emote with it more. \n The illustrations were great, the style and subject worked with the poem they were place next to. Their rough style also added to the rough edged feel of this book and I loved it. \n This book felt so therapeutic and when I was reading it I thought of several people who I want to read this book. The way I would recommend this book to people is if you have had issues with your family and relationships as well as self image and mental health, you NEED this book. \n It's a great book, the poetry is beautiful, it's really well put together and published and anyone should read this but I think it can REALLY help some people and it's so beautifully therapeutic that despite being really sad in a lot of parts, it actually makes you feel better after finishing it.","date":"2016-06-07"}

And that's just it: I did feel quite a strong connection to some of the poems in Kaur's book, but at times the work overall does feel fragmented, especially since the author seems to rely on the use of a lot of cliche quotes and advice in some of her poems. \n However, all of her original thoughts and the amount they add to this work are all so interesting.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"This book was passionate and vulnerable, but also powerful and resonant. I really loved it. The beauty behind Kaur's work here is that, while this doesn't apply to every single poem in this collection, several of these poems have the ability to say a lot in very few words. \n I would be the first to admit that contemporary poetry in this vein (such as Amanda Lovelace's \"The Princess Saves Herself in this One\") are not usually for me. I find the simplicity of it uninspired, and I find there to be a lack of the kinds of imagery and poetic diction that really appeal to me. However, Kaur has proven herself to be the exception to this rule for me. It's true that this collection doesn't paint as much imagery for me as I would have liked, but there are a lot of poems in this collection that made me think, and that seemed very poignant. For example, \n The drawings throughout also gave the collection a very particular feel and aesthetic that I really liked. The sketchy, imperfect doodles really made the book feel very personal, and I loved that touch. \n That being said, there were still a few poems in this collection that fall into a subcategory that I personally find exhausting: the preachy feminist advice poem. This isn't to say that I dislike any of these things separately (here for feminism, literally always in need of advice) but I find these poems tend to all blend together and just echo the same sentiments over and over: love yourself, don't let a man define you, etc etc. \n Overall, I'd say I really enjoyed this little gem and I'm looking forward to more from Rupi Kaur. \n read this review and more @ maybe books","date":"2016-06-25"}

In a little over 200 pages you can see a path that begins in the pain and trauma of childhood experiences and end in a conclusion of learning and growth that denotes a lot of strength and courage. \n I love the illustration and the ideas Kaur made about the book separates these various themes into four parts: the hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing. \n Also the final, about the messages from the reader and the author... so unique.","date":"2016-11-04"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"*accidentally deleted my first review, oops* \n This is a book that I wanted to love, but it was disappointing. So many people raved about and said it changed their life, but for me, it was pretty basic. \n \"Milk and Honey\" is a collection of poetry and prose split into four parts: the hurting, the loving, the breaking and the healing. It deals with abuse, trauma, love and femininity. Kaur`s writing is beautiful, very raw and powerful. I enjoyed it and a couple of her poems truly resonated with me. But other bits were underwhelming and they felt too much like Tumblr poetry. And there`s nothing bad about that, but it was not what I expected. Blame in on the hype, but I wanted more. \n For me, the best part of this poetry collection was \"The Hurting\". For those that dealt with parental abuse and child molestation, this section can be triggering. The poems were sometimes hard to read, but they were beautiful and emotional. It is hard to explain what I felt because it is not something that I experienced. I did not have a negative fatherly figure and I was raised in a loving environment. But just because it did not happen to me, it doesn`t mean it`s not real. And I`m not talking only about the abuse. Little girls are still raised to be quiet and reserved, to do what others want in order to be \"good girls\". So Kaur addressed the issues that arise from this upbringing, the scars it can leave. Like I said earlier, it was a good section. \n Sadly, after this part, everything started to go downhill. I was not a fan of \"The Loving\" section at all and there were moments when I thought I would eye roll myself into another dimension. I am not a fan of love poems, so maybe someone else might enjoy this part. I also felt that it was too sexualised, reducing love to physical contact. \"The Breaking\" and \"The Healing\" were good, with some impactful poems. But overall, the book is lacking consistency and 80% of the poems were \"Meh\". (wish I had a better word to describe them) \n Overall, it`s not a bad poetry collection, but it`s also not as good as others say it is.

{"book_id":"96259","rating":5,"review_text":"There's a desperation in every page of this book, a longing that stirs in your fingertips and claws down your throat, an unspoken regret, a complicated past and a desolate present that are tied together by scattered pieces throughout the book, repetitions of things like Hollywood and the movie of their life, burglars and monsters, climbing up a ladder and reaching \"the last rung.\" There's a dark grief in every word, a volatile mix of emotions that brings tears to your eyes but which lacks the kindness to make them fall. The shadow of death sits quietly in the margin of every page, gathering strength and solidifying the further you delve. It confronts you directly at scattered points throughout the book, and then it shies back into it's silence. The poems themselves are intensely honest in a way that acts like a pane of glass. You can look in, but you can't touch, because it's not for you. None of this is for you. And I love every piece of it, the black humanity of it. This is undoubtedly my favorite book of poetry. \n - \n You are a fever I'm learning to live with, and everything is happening // at the wrong end of a very long tunnel. \n Straw House, Straw Dog \n You were sitting in a bathtub at the hospital and you were crying. // You said it hurt. // I mean the buildings that were not the hospital. // I shouldn't have mentioned the hospital. // I don't think I can take this much longer. \n ... \n In these dreams it's always you: // The boy in the sweatshirt, // The boy on the bridge, the boy who always keeps me // from jumping off the bridge. // Oh, the things we invent when we are scared \n and want to be rescued. // Your jeep. Your teeth. The coffee that you bought me. // the sandwich cut in half on the plate. // I woke up and ate ice cream in the dark, // hunched over on // the wooden chair in the kitchen, // listening to the rain. // I borrowed your shoes and didn't put them away. \n .. \n I put you in a cage with the ocelots. I was trying to fatten you up // with sausages and bacon. // Somehow you escaped and climbed up the branches of a pear tree. // I chopped it down but there was nobody in it. // I went to the riverbed to wait for you to show up. // You didn't show up. // I kept waiting. \n I Had a Dream About You \n and you realize the one person in the world who loves you // isn't the one you thought it would be, // and you don't trust him to love you in a way // you would enjoy. // And the boy who loves you the wrong way is filthy. // And the boy who loves you the wrong way keeps weakening. // You thought if you handed over your body // he'd do something interesting. \n A Primer For the Small Weird Loves \n Imagine a room, // a sudden glow. Here is my hand, my heart, // my throat, my wrist. Here are the illuminated // cities at the center of me, and here is the center // of me, which is a lake, which is a well that we // can drink from, but I can't go through with it. // I just don't want to die anymore. \n Saying Your Names \n and my favorite quote of all time: \n Sorry // about the blood in your mouth.

I loved the artwork in the book, I'll say that.I did like a few of the poems, even though I could not relate to them.

Maybe I am carried away by equivalent poetry books, but it just seemed to miss something. The protagonist fell for a guy and then her whole world collapsed when he left her (spoiler alert), but at points it seemed that the reactions to this said breakup were kind of exaggerated. I don't remember the exact poem, but it was mentioned that you only fall in love once and all the rest simply compare to this idealized love (obviously I am not quoting, but the meaning was meant to portray that). \n I understand that this book was about overcoming (but not really) a breakup that hurt her, though it lacked depth and it seemed like describing a cliche romantic comedy taking place in high school. \n I will read her other books too since I have them, but I am not sure how easily she can change my mind after this one.

{"book_id":"19351","rating":4,"review_text":"There is something special about reading a story as old as Gilgamesh. Human beings are essentially the same today as 4 millennia ago. We still crave intimacy and fear death. \n I think that anyone who reads Gilgamesh will be struck by how closely the story of the flood mirrors the flood story depicted in the bible. The two stories may, in fact, be as similar as they seem, but maybe not. Mitchell admits, readily, that he can't read Akkadian nor can he decipher cuneiform. His version of Gilgamesh is based on earlier translations coupled with his own creative license. There is no complete, ancient work of Gilgamesh. So, all translations are pieced together from fragmented sources, and the experience, knowledge and culture of the translator influences the translation. \n One thing I would disagree with some about is the relationship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu. Readers seem to believe that they had a sexual relationship, but sexuality seems to be easily discussed and described throughout the book. If the two had a sexual relationship, there is no reason to believe it wouldn't have been explicitly stated. Instead, over and over, the non-sexual quality of their relationship is emphasized. Enkidu and Gilgamesh are described repeatedly as being brothers. People seem determined to add a sexual component to their relationship, but I just don't see it. \n This version of Gilgamesh is very readable. The plot is interesting is interesting and moves quickly.","date":"2017-01-07"}

{"book_id":"2696","rating":3,"review_text":"The Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer \n I don't know how I manage to find the classics that are poetry without knowing before hand that they're poetry. I also don't know why poetry makes me want to bang my head against a wall. But, it's an easy and quite an interesting read with a lot of great quotable lines. \n Growing up in the era I have, I'm completely desensitized to what is considered racy and shocking and I don't expect every literary classic labeled as a \"tale\" to have some kind of special meaning, but I have to admit, I wasn't prepared for the outright smut that peppered the first few tales. Very comical indeed. The more adult tales suited me better. And there were a couple of stories I was rather enjoying when the Host cut them off for being inferior or other reasons. I'm not sure why the translator chose to summarize the tales that were done in prose instead of transcribing them as was unless that's how Chaucer framed this work in the first place. \n I'm glad I read it. I give it 3 of 5 stars. But, it's a book that would do better in a discussion setting - classroom or book club - rather than recreational reading. It's a springboard for much conversation, surely.","date":"2016-05-19"}

I could categorize much of his work under the Horror/Thriller genre and Poe does it just the way I like it. I've always thought that Horror works best in a short story format... like campfire stories. Any longer and it starts to get ridiculous for me. \n Of course, it's not all Horror which is what surprised me the most when I first read the book. There are some comical stories in there, such as Why The Little Frenchman Wears His Arm In A Sling, The Spectacles, and Never Bet The Devil Your Head. The latter was kind of dark, but I found it terribly funny. Then there were mysteries like The Murders In The Rue Morgue and The Mystery of Marie Roget. Poe is very versatile.

My religious and political beliefs are already set in stone, so this book gave me no sway to any other direction. I recommend that the person reading this also be settled in their views. It makes it easier. \n It is a very old work, but there are plenty of footnotes in the version I have so that you can tell who Dante was referencing throughout his journey, if you're unaware. He blends Greek Mythology with Catholic catechism in many instances. The thing it most inspires me to do is study the historical time frame when Dante was writing and of his own exile and politics. The overview said there was humor in it, but most of it went past me since I'm unfamiliar with the social/political structure of 14th century Italy. I found personal whimsies when realizing some references that have often been made, probably because of this book; such as, hell freezing over, the deepest circle being reserved for traitors, sending someone to the 10th level of hell (Dante's only went to 9), and even \"digging your way through to China\" as being pictured in classic cartoons as being upside down to the other hemisphere of the world.

{"book_id":"27494","rating":5,"review_text":"I didn't put a finish date, because how do you finish Leaves of Grass? Whitman never did. He was always changing it and adding things. \n The title and the epigraph for Little Wrecks come from here, from a section titled 'Sea drift'. Whitman grew up on Long Island, like me, and his descriptions of the beaches and the ocean and the feeling of being on that island feel like home to me. I also just plain love the writing. Like all my favourite writers, Whitman has amazing rhythm and a kind of mystical lyricism that is not at all fashionable in contemporary 'literary' work.","date":"2016-04-12"}
{"book_id":"22151696","rating":4,"review_text":"\"The work of poet and artist Lang Leav swings between the whimsical and woeful, expressing a complexity beneath its childlike facade.\" \n I couldn't agree more. Some reviewers pointed out that Leav's poems could've been easily written by any random fifth-graders, and even *they* (these reviewers) have written similar poems in elementary school. Okay, well, congratulations. Really. But this remains true: it is precisely the childlike quality of Leav's poems that is her genius. \n Yes, the words, the verses are quite simple and straightforward. They remind me of children innocently proclaiming the pure simple truths of everyday. Sometimes we adults must learn to shed all our adult intricacies and complexities to appreciate these truths that may sound like cliches to us. But even cliches are called cliches for a reason. More often than not they speak universal truths, buried deep down in our subconscious, but they manage to appear here and there where we're least guarded. Like when we're in love. \n I could go on and on, but I have work to do, so enough philosophizing. The verdict: Lullabies is a book that I will read again and again and I'm certain to find fresh new meanings with every reading.","date":"2016-04-10"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"As someone who struggles with anxiety and depression, the simplistic beauty of Kaur's \"milk and honey\" struck a chord with my soul. The book is a story of pain and trauma, and learning to cope and become stronger as an individual. I'm usually quite a snob and thought I would find Kaur's poems to be, as many have said, overly-simplistic or lacking in insight. But on the contrary, I found their simplicity inspiring. Kaur is direct and to the point- her poetry is really more of what I describe as a lyrical, breathy prose. Yes, sometimes it reads like a high-schooler's journal, but there's nothing wrong with that. There is beauty in simplicity, in pain, and in struggle, and I think Kaur is able to convert her pain into something that feels tangible and refreshing. I personally adored this book on my first read-through; it came to me at a time in my life when I really needed it. Kaur's book is powerful and purposeful- and it has earned its place as a favorite among my shelf.","date":"2017-05-24"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"I enjoyed this book and the artwork that it contained. \"milk and honey\"was at times \"right in your face\" poetry. This poetess speaks her truth in this book. She once was ashamed, but through her poetry she is no longer ashamed. \n Ms. Kaur is considered a contemporary poetess. She began her journey of writing on Tumblr and then on Instagram, known now as an Instapoet; she has, as of this writing, 832K followers. Through social media exposure she has a wide-spread following; young and old alike. Now Ms. Kaur has become a spokesperson for younger women as she writes poems about subjects once thought taboo. In 2014, Ms. Kaur was able to self-publish her first poetry book on Amazon entitled \"milk and honey\". Her book garnered so much success and that it was picked up for a second printing in 2015 by Andrews McMeel Publishing. \n The subject matter in her book \"milk and honey\" are themes of sexual violence, abuse, loss, love and femininity/womanhood.

Immediately something seemed a bit 'different' on the audio. I forgot that this book is a series of poems, almost a stream of thought at times. I wondered if perhaps I would loose something on this by not having the print, and listening to the audio.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"\"Autoayudate que dios te autoayudara\" - Carlos Monsivais \n Tuve muchos problemas con Milk and Honey. Muchos. Lo lei en dos sentadas (1: the hurting y the loving, y 2: the breaking y the healing, que son las cuatro partes en las que se divide), porque la mayor parte de los poemas tienen cinco lineas y puede pasarse por ellos con la misma facilidad con la que se baja en la pagina de inicio de Twitter. \n No es solo porque sean cortos. \n Tambien porque su recurso mas usual es tomar frases hechas, adecuarlas a la extension segun una particion de versos libres, y dotar al comentario-poema de un \"algo\" de ingenio. Muy como Twitter. O Tumblr. Y eso, segun he visto en otras resenas, da resultado: se adecua a cierto tipo de recepcion, no es para nada dificil de leer, el mensaje va clarisimo y directo (el lenguaje no es sencillo, es simplista), los temas pertenecen a una agenda feminista (solo superficialmente*, la idea no es crear polemica). Mezclamos y hay exito editorial. Luego, para blindar, decimos que la poeta es sincera, que hay mucha honestidad en los poemas de Rupi Kaur, y que habla de lo que no se habla. \n Bien: no es suficiente ser honestos, ni abordar temas tabu. No es suficiente hablar desde el fondo del alma. La literatura no esta hecha de buenas intenciones. Hay que poder ir mas alla, mas dentro que el fondo. \n No quiero ese ingenio facil en la poesia. No quiero versos tipo: \n don't mistake \n salt for sugar \n if he wants to \n be with you \n he will \n it's that simple. (81) \n Frente a ellos solo puedo reiterar ese comentario de Monsivais con el que abro la resena. \n No quiero autoayuda en la poesia, no quiero consejos para vivir, no quiero certezas zen de sabiduria bajada de internet. Quiero vertigo, y hielo puro, y dolor, y estridencia, y llamarada. No quiero un arte que me arrope y me trate con la condescendencia de los que creen que triunfaron (\"-Ya, ya, tranquilo, yo tambien sufri, lo que tienes que hacer para dejar de hacerlo es...\"). Quiero la compania de los otros que se descubren derrotados, que estan perdidos, que no comprenden. \n Llegue a esta autora entusiasmado**, mi decepcion fue mayuscula. \n No, gracias pero no. Me quedo con Plath, con Dickinson, y con el deber de revisar la poesia norteamericana actual para levantarme el animo. \n ---------------------------------------- \n Ahora, los asteriscos: \n El primero *, tiene que ver con el llamado feminismo que enuncian varias criticas. Kaur habla del abuso sexual, de la menstruacion, de su ser mujer en el mundo. Cuando no es claramente panfletaria (ya he hablado antes de mis dudas al aproximarse a los textos con un prejuicio frente a esto: no esta mal, de entrada, ser panfleto), como en el poema de la menstruacion, se diria que trabaja para visibilizar lo femenino desde la escritura, haciendolo en una doble construccion: la mujer que se aduena de sus problemas, de su cuerpo, de sus sentimientos, y consigue emancipacion desde su autodefinicion (Kaur, por supuesto, da las claves para hacerlo); y el reconocimiento del papel de la sororidad en el proyecto feminista (el poema \"you tell me\" (163) siendo su mencion mas evidente). \n Sin embargo, encontre en la lectura muchos poemas apuntando a lo contrario. El que pongo a continuacion me parece terrible, y no solo porque lo considero una linea mediocre de conquista (la he oido con variaciones en varios bares): \n you talk too much \n he whispers into my ear \n i can think of better ways to use that mouth (65) \n Como parte del sistema de paradojas que sostiene el interes del mundo, ese es el poema que escogio la editorial Espasa para cambiarle el titulo al libro en espanol (\"Miel y leche\" les sonaba a coleccion de recetas para dormir bien), que, traducido por Elvira Sastre se llamo Otras maneras de usar la boca. \n Tal vez a Sastre le salto la misma alarma que a mi al leerlo, y por eso se concedio licencia de cambiar el \"better\" del original por el \"otras\" de la traduccion. Pero no es \"otras\" lo que dice el, susurrado en su oido; no es una invitacion de intercambio equivalente. El dice \"mejores\". \n Luego, el esfuerzo de sororidad de Kaur en \"you tell me\" (163) tiene vigencia mientras no este despechada. En ese poema, la autora insiste en desmontar el cliche de \"no eres como las demas\", haciendo notar lo negativo de la expresion: para ser elogiada debe considerar inferiores a las demas mujeres. Bien. Pero en poemas previos de desamor no dudara en mencionar su superioridad femenina, y en como, mientras el este con la otra estara pensando en ella, porque es inolvidable, y unica, y diferente. \n Al escribir se le pueden prender velas a dios y al diablo, no hay problemas con esto, en absoluto. Parte de la habilidad de los escritores esta en decir, con igual gracia, lo uno y lo opuesto. Mi lio aqui no es con la autora, sino con el ejercicio de los lectores, con el uso del feminismo como comodin. \n El ano pasado lei Yo tambien soy Frida Slaw, valdria la pena leerlo, en esa clave, comparandolo con Milk and Honey. \n El segundo asterisco (se me fue muy largo esto), tiene que ver con el entusiasmo**: llegue a Kaur luego de ver una charla TED donde recita un poema titulado \"Regular tuesday\" (creo). Me gusto... Luego descubri que no esta en este libro. Luego descubri que era muy similar a uno de los monologos de Ensler en The Vagina Monologues... Y me gusto mas el de Ensler.","date":"2017-02-16"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"This book was another excursion into new literary genres for me. Although we analyse poems in school and university to their bones and maybe read the occasional verses on tumblr or instagram, I have actually never read an entire book of poetry myself, simply for enjoyment. \n I was surprised that although the poems stand individually, together they convey a story. Milk and Honey is inherently a deeply personal and very modern journey. Some parts I could not really relate to, which is not too much of a problem as the poems are short and can be read quickly even if a particular one is not for you. Not 'getting' every part of it actually makes me want to read the entire book again to see whether I will understand them better at some point later in life. \n On the whole though, I really enjoyed the poems. There are still many relatable, powerful, uplifting and empowering messages that celebrate femininity, resiliance and life, that I am convinced everyone could find at least one that speaks to them. It also inspired me to write more poetry again, which to me is always a sign of true art, and this is also what the book feels like. An honest glimpse into the thoughts and feelings of the authoress herself, almost like an extended part of her. \n If you want to get a sense of her poems, follow Rupi Kaur on Instagram or browse the hashtag #milkandhoney. This is by no means sponsored or intended to discourage you from getting a copy of the book. I simply found it wonderful that this way you can see if you respond to her poetry, and if you do you will want to read more anyway.

HOW UTTERLY WRONG I WAS! \n Milk and Honey, I believe, tells a story of all females, young and old; different women from different walks of life that are going through love, tragedy, and trauma and simply surviving. It tells how women amidst problems, survive. It tells women to love themselves. Put themselves first before all others, so they won't feel afraid or lost. It teaches women how to grasp a strength that they thought they didn't have and hold on to it. \n I appreciate Rupi Kaur for creating such a wonderful piece of artwork that will give women and even men a sense of what femininity is. That you should not be afraid of being a woman. As a woman, to want respect is to have respect in yourself; to have that conviction that you deserve to be respected.

{"book_id":"1420","rating":5,"review_text":"** spoiler alert ** \n I have only read Shakespeare when I had to at school but Hamlet I read of my own will, and that's probably why I appreciate it more than Shakespeare's other plays. Besides it's been recommended by a non-English-teacher. \n To be or not to be is not the only question in this play to be answered, in fact that question is answered when Hamlet is finally reconciled with the idea of death. It is only then that he summons the courage to fight. Hamlet is not your average wronged Prince in shining armor determined to avenge his father, instead he is an emotionally unstable and hesitant Prince troubled with many philosophical questions of morality, love, loyalty, family, incest and revenge. One of the most admirable qualities of Hamlet is his morality, which stops him from killing Claudius when he finds him praying, but this image of Hamlet is soon shattered when he takes the innocent life of Polonius. \n The more pressing question in Hamlet is when to avenge, and how to. Had its not been for Gertrude's falling right before his eyes and the undeniable fact that it was Clausius's doing would King Hamlet have been avenged at all? Hamlet was inevitably going to die in his fight with Laertes but it was not so inevitable that he would avenge his father. It's interesting to see Hamlet's revenge plot progress so slowly, but then comes a rush of events in which everything is settled in the very last scene. \n Another interesting aspect is the role of women in this play. Despite their weakness and dependence on the men around them they play a big role in the progress of the plot. Gertrude's death is what finally leads to Hamlet to kill Clausius, and Ophelia's love story with Hamlet is thought to be the reason for his madness. \n Speaking of Hamlet's madness, it is unclear whether he is pretending or at times actually mad. The sexual connotations of his conversation with Ophelia during the play (within the play) certainly make him seem mad, and if not then he is deliberately tormenting her leaving us wonder whether he is as pure/moral as we thought him to be. The level of his wit surely can't be a mad man's. Certainly his \"exile\" changes him and he seems to be much more stable upon his return. \n Shakespeare leaves many questions unanswered, and many levels to be explored. For example, did Claudius know that Hamlet knew of the murder of his father, or was Claudius nervous because in the show it was the nephew that killed his uncle, indicating that Hamlet too may kill his uncle? And what is the extent of Ophelia's relationship with Hamlet? Following her father's' death she claims that men have intercourse with women and promise to marry them, but afterwards they don't because the women are no longer virgins. Is that her case with Hamlet or has she simply gone made? \n Finally, I would like to see a production of Hamlet now to see how the ghost was played, and how the play within a play was aranged.","date":"2016-06-07"}

The scene I really missed was the one where the oh-so-holy Isabella asks Mariana to \"fill in\" for her with Angelo in order to save Isabella's brother. That was a request that took some gall!

I'm no poetry expert, but this seemed to be a collection of jumbled ramblings. It felt very disjointed and difficult to read. It gives the vibe that it is from someone's journal which they have scraped together at 3am one morning. Which is fine, but not something I would anticipate to be published, let alone end up on the New York Times bestseller list. \n The content not only felt repetitive and often basic (\"there is a difference between someone telling you they love you and them actually loving you\" --insert random gaps in between), but somewhat contradictory. For example, the author mentioned ideas that all women are \"resilient and striking\", how women all need to band together, etc etc, however in other poems talks about how the next woman who comes along for her ex-partner will somehow be lesser than her, a \"sad replacement\" of her. \n I can understand why this might appeal particularly to female teenage Tumblr users who like to put random spacing in between sentences and not use capital letters, however it only frustrated me. I believe it would actually be better if it had been typed out \"normally\" rather than randomly hitting the enter button to separate words. \n I'll give it 1.5 stars as it was brave to have some hard-hitting topics in there, and some of the poems/sentences resonated.

{"book_id":"13105527","rating":1,"review_text":"This book had such great potential with a captivating title and an alluring abstract. However, it fell far from my expectations, to the point where I am happy this book was gifted to me rather than going out and spending the money myself. This is a book of what I would loosely call poetry. It may be poetry in an extreme Tumblr-esque type way (not that there are not good poets on Tumblr), however I personally viewed it more as pieces of flash fiction mixed with quotes about life and love. \n The \"Poems\" \n Let me start by saying there were some good pieces in this book. There were gems hidden throughout that I personally really enjoyed (\"The Circus Is Cheaper When It Rains,\" \"The Seconds Before Launch,\" The Fragments Belong Together,\" \"The World Is Better Backwards,\" and \"The Dwindling Conversation\" were what I personally found to be the best). However, a majority of the book felt like I was scrolling through a word porn page on Facebook, reading recycled quotes, or reading another one of those open letters to *insert literally anyone* that you could kind of connect with but left you with this yearning for more. Some of the quotes are speaking to you as a reader and could apply to most anyone (see the last 30 pages), and the rest feel like I'm reading someone's diary entries cut up and reorganized into a letter to a significant other. One redeeming quality to maybe a third of the poems is the use of the titles in relation to the overall meaning. There were times when the title made the quote actually noteable, such as \"The Leftovers.\" Other times, however, the title seemed a little too askew and abstract, such as \"The Seraphim And The Pirate.\" \n The Pictures \n The worst aspect of the book is the pictures. They do not fit. Most of them look like stock photos someone found during a google search and don't offer much insight into the poems. Each piece had its own picture, but only a few seemed to correlate with the poems. Maybe if I took the time to reread the book a handful of times I would be able to see some deep artistic connection that I am just currently unable to appreciate. However, this book doesn't give me any inclination to want to read it. \n Formatting \n I did appreciate how some of the poems turned sideways. While it probably wasn't necessary, it did make it more interesting and caught my attention in the midst of the stream of poor quotes. However, the arrangement of the poems felt sloppy. I could not really tell a difference between the various sections until the last one--the attention of the poems seemed to be pointed back at us as readers and not the lost lover. Otherwise it seemed like a back and forth fight within every section to decide if the atuhor loves or hates their last partner with \"insights\" to life randomly stuck in. Maybe the author was trying to convey the back and forth emotions following a break up, however it could have been better executed if that is the case. \n Personally, I won't be rereading this book again any time soon. I wanted more from it the entire time and I think if I had put it down (it is an entirely easy read and only took me an hour), I wouldn't have picked it back up. This book is for people coming right out a break up, or deeply in love, or dealing with a break up horribly because they are still deeply in love. It isn't worth your time if you are looking for poetry with real depth.","date":"2016-12-13"}

If we're going to use the goodreads rating system of 3 stars being 'liked it' and 2 stars being 'it was ok', then the latter is much more accurate. \n I don't usually read poetry and only read Milk and Honey because of the hype surrounding it, but I personally think it's been extremely over-hyped and is quite overrated. Again, this is what i personally think so if you loved it so much and feel like it's forever in your heart, then that's great. \n Maybe I just don't appreciate poetry or maybe my expectations going into this book were way too high, but I just didn't enjoy it. I'm not denying that there weren't a handful of poems that I really enjoyed and I might re-read from time to time but overall, as a collection, I just found Milk and Honey really bland.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"I'm not a poet, nor really familiar with poetry, but considering how Rupi's words have become renown around the world, must mean that it pleases some poets and artists as well as connects with people who fall in love and out of love, survived sexual assault/violent relationships, who learn to love themselves. I'm definitely in the latter category. That said, in the beginning, I felt her poems were distinctive and very vulnerable in expressing the traumas she experienced. This is probably where I made a general update that this should be required reading in women's studies classics because it deals with the assault she experienced as a young child and teenager, how it affected her, how she recognized her pain. While I wouldn't take back this plea necessarily, the poems began to feel blander...and, not as original, almost like the internet is saturated with passages in the later chapters that I've read online before which made them feel too familiar in style and wording. \n I don't believe a poet is meant to hit an emotional current of feels every. single. time. My favorite authors don't boggle my mind or tug on my heartstrings with every sentence (so I feel like some of the reviews on here are a little harsh....) About a half a dozen, maybe a few more, poems struck a chord with me. What is evident throughout the book is Rupi capturing an essence of being a woman - someone who endured heartbreak and came out a stronger person who loved herself and recognized sisterhood in other women.

It's here, an atmosphere \n Surrounds the town. Builds some up, knocks me down. \n Meanwhile the rabble ruled by body \n Pleasures, thankless beasts overburdened \n Build toward a bundle of remorse \n In drugged dances. Blues, take my hand, \n Come from them, come here. Look behind me \n At the defunct years, at the balconies \n Of heaven; in tattered copes, rise out \n Of the waters of Regret. The sun sleeps \n Moribund on a buttress; and listen, \n My true-blues, hear dusk's sweet steps. \n --see my Goodreads writings for my trans of L'Imprevu \n We have Baudelaire to thank for the world renown of our second-rate 19C poet Edgar Allan a Po-po-poe -dee-oh. (First rate storyteller, imitated fairly well by Dickens, once.) When a genius translates a less-than; other examples, TS Eliot's LaForgue? Moliere's anybody? \n Baudelaire also took crap from the French Government same year Flaubert got off because of the rank of his father: his defense lawyer argued a guilty verdict would impugn Dr Flaubert, much as Lizzie Borden's father was used in her defense in the courtroom a few miles from my house. Since they lost the Flaubert case, they went with zeal after Baudelaire, managed to win, stop his publisher and him in their tracks until they dropped ten poems, later printed as Les epaves (below). \n I think Charley B was a nasty little prick (a word I use advisedly, rarely, un petit bite); see his love poem to a corpse. But..and this is a bigger but(t) than Charley's...he was a genuine genius. Unfortunately. His opening address to his reader as his Brother Hypocrite gives insight into our recent US presidential winner. (And of course, he calls me, his reader, his brother hypocrite--as I condescend from the great heights of my superior morality.) \n I am sure I would be disgusted by Charley B0-bo-bo-dee-baudelaire. I would not vote for him, but I must vote for his disgusting verse. (One demurer, B himself says that writing draws one away from screwing, so he has created the disgust as an artistic enfranchisement.) \n And, may I say having translated from a half dozen languages--and published them--Charley's Blues evoked a bit of his genius in me. \n As an American \"baby-boomer,\" I've never understood the Russian / Pushkin's obsession with skuchno, boredom, but I find its source here in empire France, Russia's birth-culture (as ours is England). Peut etre it's a remnant of upper class, Marie Antoinette France. Baudelaire's opening address to his reader ends with the descent of the Monster, \"Ennui.\" \n Gems throughout, almost any poem can be praised in its concentrated, tidal pull. Say, a little sheaf, Les epaves, \"Wrecks\" like the two schooners that rested on the shore of my childhood in Wiscasset, Maine (Hesper and the Luther Little). Awakening very late, he must pursue the sun god as s/he retires, loses out to the god Nuit, humid and full of chill. An odor of the tomb, the swampy residence of snails and toads. \n Or the art-painting in Prison, by Delacroix, Tasso on his bed, turning pages with his feet, inflamed with a terror of the dizzying (circular) stairs into the depths of his soul. Laughter fills the prison, with Doubt and Fear (again not unlike US politics 2016) circling with grimaces and wails, awakening from horrid dreams to find himself surrounded by four walls. The Real. \n His wonderful praise of Daumier defends the comedic historian's mockery, not the harsh laugh of Satan, but the gentle satire of the benevolent. (Europeans often suspect laughter; only the English writer embraces it always...though not in the 2017 Nobel winner.) \n Two short poems are among Les epaves, which he ends by addressing his harsh critic Monselet; but first, Part II of his Monster, the Macabre Nymph: \n Fool, you should go straight to the Devil! \n I'm even happy to go with you, \n If not for this frightful haste \n Which leaves me agitated. Then, \n Well, better You--go straight to Hell! (Garnier, 199) \n Then, finally, \"A Frisky Cabaret\" (un cabaret folatre): \n You who dote on skeletons \n And detestable cliches \n To spice your voluptuous taste, \n (Stick to simple omelettes!) \n Oh great Pharaoh, King Monselet! \n In front of your unforeseen \n Instruction, I dream of you: In a bar \n At the cemetery, six feet deep.","date":"2016-12-01"}

It was a quick and engrossing read - I'm not sure I looked up from my perch on the book aisle shelf once, even with frequent passersby. \n I'd never read a book of poetry from cover to cover before, and I'm very glad I broke that trend today. As is natural (I assume), certain poems and sections resonated and struck me more deeply than others. \"The Healing,\" the last section, was nothing short of exquisite and extraordinary. I cannot quite say that about the piece as a whole, however; it was very good, but not quite a masterpiece. \n All the same, I'd like to thank Rupi Kaur for baring her soul ro the world and taking the reader on this painful, inspiring jourmey. She is a brave, courageous woman who, I hope, will never stop writing.","date":"2017-04-14"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"I was really really hoping that the recent feminist superstar Rupi Kaur's first poetry collection would be worthy of all the hype. Unfortunately it isn't. Despite all the five-star reviews on Goodreads, this is at best a mediocre work of poetry. At worst, it's lame, filled with cliches and suffocatingly full of words. There are a few gems (like like the often quoted \"you tell me to quiet down because\") hidden away between the embarrassingly simple and explicit \"poems\" that really only live up to that name if what you think of as \"poetry\" is based on Instagram motivational quotes and fridge magnets. \n But its worst sin is the depressing excess of material that goes against the whole idea of poetry - if you can say what you want to with five words, don't use fifty. If you can tell a story with one poem, don't write ten. And whatever you do, don't label what's already naively simple poems with \"explanatory\" names like \"father\", and definitely do not, (really please don't), triple the effect by adding an illustration that nails the meaning of the poem in place. Poetry is meant to be flexible. You're killing it. \n Naturally if one uses some other criteria than \"what's good poetry\" to judge its value, that's another story altogether.","date":"2016-09-14"}
{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"When this poetry collection came in stock at work I decided to give it a quick read behind the counter on account of hearing so much about it through the grapevine. \n Well, I felt terrible reading it. \n The themes that Kaur takes up in her poems are interesting enough, and often very dark, but the lack of craft put into most of these poems(?) make them incredible funny to read. I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy when I began to snicker from behind the counter while reading about sexual violence - but it was hard not to when nearly every conceit and imagery in these poems were trite and overused to the point of hilarity. \n I suppose that when I pick up a poetry collection I want it to evoke the feeling of walking down a barely trodden path deep in the mountains. I want to feel that the poet approaches her themes in a manner that is unique and interesting. Reading Kaur felt more like walking by the side of a highway - bleak and familiar to the point of boredom. \n I liked the drawings though.","date":"2017-08-18"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"'you were a dragon long before \n he came around and said \n you could fly \n you will remain a dragon \n long after he's left' \n milk and honey by Rupi Kaur is a collection of poetry that centers around femininity and survival. It was inspiring, shocking, beautiful and thought provoking. \n milk and honey, although a beautiful read, was shocking in parts. It in no way strays from hard topics, that I myself wouldn't pick up usually. The poems were beautifully written, and easily pulled emotions out of readers. I give a lot of credit to the writer for leaving her blood, sweat and tears in the pages of milk and honey. \n The poetry was split up into four sections, the hurting, the loving, the breaking and the healing, and the healing was by far my favourite section. It was full of inspiration that I believe are lost in women's lives sometimes. You must love yourself, a partner doesn't make you, he does not complete you, he complements you. You do not need a man to be happy, you should be happy with yourself and milk and honey really touched on this perfectly. \n It's difficult to review a poetry book, especially because I am not an avid poetry reader. However, I enjoyed reading this books, I like that it touched on harder topics that are not always discussed, and I think the poetry was beautiful to read, with illustrations that complemented the words to perfection. I did find the book lacked longer poetry though, with many poems only lasting a few words. \n What's interesting about milk and honey is what I learnt about myself. I am a person that doesn't need this book, I don't need to know I am important or that I need to love myself. I feel whole, without a man, without anyone because I have been brought up to feel important, strong and independent. I thank this book for helping me realize that I don't need it, however I know people that do, and I will pass this one on knowing and being grateful for all I have. \n Here are some of my favourite poems from milk and honey and I do hope you pick up this one if you haven't already. \n 'you tell me to quiet down cause \n my opinions make me less beautiful \n but i was not made with a fire in my belly \n so i could be put out \n i was not made with a lightness on my tongue \n so i could be easy to swallow \n i was made heavy \n half blade and half silk \n difficult to forget and not easy \n for the mind to follow' \n 'i will not have you \n build me into your life \n when \n what i want is to \n build a life with you' \n 'you are in the habit \n of co-depending \n on people to \n make up for what \n you think you lack \n who ticked you \n into believing \n another person \n was meant to complete you \n when the most they can do is complement' \n Rating: 4/5","date":"2016-12-25"}

Ia menjadi anak tunggal dari pasangan Thomas Stevenson dan Margaret Balfour. Stevenson memiliki paru-paru yang lemah yang diwarisi dari ibunya. Ketika usianya belum genap dua tahun, seorang wanita muda yang bernama Alison Cunningham bergabung dalam lingkaran keluarganya dan wanita muda itu pun menjadi perawatnya. Lebih dari tiga puluh tahun kemudian, Stvenson menuliskan sejumlah puisi masa kecilnya yang terhimpun dalam buku A Child's Garden of Verses. Buku itu didedikasikan kepada perawatnya. Di usia awal Stevenson, ia termasuk anak yang lambat untuk memiliki kemampuan membaca, namun beruntungnya, Cummy (panggilan perawatnya) senang membacakan cerita-cerita untuknya. \n Melalui puisi-puisi dalam buku tersebut, kehidupan masa kecil Stevenson pun terungkap dan bagaimana ia memandang kehidupan atau dunia di sekitarnya. Salah satu puisi yang berjudul \"The Land of Counterpane\" menggambarkan ketika ia tengah dalam keadaan tidak sehat. \n Ketika aku sakit dan berbaring di tempat tidur, \n Aku punya dua bantal di kepalaku, \n Dan semua mainan berbaring di sampingku \n Untuk membuatku bahagia sepanjang hari. \n \"The Land of Counterpane.\" \n Terdapat 65 buah puisi dalam buku itu. Satu per satu sejumlah puisi dalam buku A Child's Garden of Verses akan membawa kita masuk ke dunia Stevenson ketika masih kanak-kanak. Beberapa puisi yang terkenal dalam karyanya ini adalah \"The Land of Counterpane\", \"My Shadow dan \"The Lamplighter.\" Apa lagi jika kita tiba pada kalimat, \n Di dunia ini dipenuhi dengan begitu banyak benda \n Aku yakin kita semua wajib berbahagia seperti para raja \n \"Happy Thought.\" \n Sepertinya pada puisi ini digambarkan bahwa anak-anak adalah pemilik segala hal. Menjadi seorang raja dan melihat dunia dipenuhi dengan apa saja yang ingin kita dapatkan. Pada Desember 1894, Robert Louis Stevenson meninggal. Usianya mencapai 44 tahun. Sedang Cummy meninggal pada usia 92 tahun. Setelah kematian Robert Louis Stevenson dan terkenalnya A Child's Garden of Verses, perawatnya, Cummy menjadi terkenal. Bagi Robert Louis Stevenson, perawatnya itulah yang benar-benar memahami apa yang dia inginkan. \n Membaca A Child's Garden of Verses dapat menjadi ruang untuk menghidupkan masa kecil dalam diri kita masing-masing. Bagaimana kita bertemu dengan pertanyaan seorang anak kecil yang tak dapat diterka; \n Apa yang anak kecil lainnya lakukan? \n Dan apa yang masa kecil, inginkan darimu? \n \"To Auntie.\" \n Beberapa versi A Child's Garden of Verses ini telah diterbitkan dengan disertai sejumlah ilustrasi yang menarik.

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":3,"review_text":"I decided to try out this book as my first poetic read. And the medals were not what caught my eye though, really I was interested in the plot. It's rare for me to read fiction these days, and when I do my taste for certain types change. Historical fiction, modern fiction, cliche school fiction, romance fiction, and all the other fiction types! \n But really I was bored, plain bored. Maybe it was because my taste for poetry is very picky, or that the plot ended up not taking me through, I am not all sure. The plot is all about a young girl who grows up with a divorced family and the fact that she is colored, makes life hard for her at the time period she grew up in. And the story just grows from there about just how she went on every day. \n I didn't really take in the poetry aspect as an interest gripper though. Really it made my satisfactory for the book go down and I fell into boredom. \n Maybe I made the mistake of trying this out as my first poetry read. For I never read a book that was ALL poetry. The cover art interested me as well which was a mistake I made and the title did as well. I WAS looking for something historical, which helped, but the poetry didn't. I guess I am not a poetry reader because this book did NOT satisfy me at all. \n And also I am not really big on every day life kind of books.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"2 stars \n Rupi Kaur's poetry collection was not what I expected. I've heard great things and raving reviews about it from two friends, but I just had a lot of issues with this collection. \n I think to start this review off, we need the definition of poetry. \n Poetry is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language--such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre--to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. \n I'm a very traditional person when it comes to literature. I use the serial comma, I like punctuating my poetry, and I stick to approximate novel word lengths. \n Despite this, I can still accept rule breaking in literature. Emily Dickinson's dramatic exclamation point and later on dash usage is one example, as J.K. Rowling's last Harry Potter book was an ungodly number of words. \n Unfortunately, I just couldn't find the purpose of rule breaking in Kaur's milk and honey. Poetry is supposed to be meaningful and moving, which Kaur does exceptionally, but it also needs to have some sort of literary skill in it. I think it's a misnomer to call milk and honey a collection of poems because it is lacking some of this artful manipulation of the English language and the rhythmic qualities in the definition of poetry. \n Poetry is not just writing from the heart. It's really not. It's more than just emotion on a page, but it doesn't have to be pretentious. It can be simpler like Emily Dickinson while still using the English language expertly. \n milk and honey could be called oddly broken up prose, but not poetry. It can be called poetically written lines, but still not poetry. I'm not trying to be cruel here and I know there are some scathing reviews of this online already. \n The literary manipulation is just not present in milk and honey, and that's why I don't classify this as poetry. \n Let's look at an excerpt as an example and analyze it: \n \"i struggle so deeply \n to understand \n how someone can \n pour their entire soul \n blood and energy \n into someone \n without wanting \n anything in \n return\" \n There is no rhyme or reason to this, no rhythmic qualities or underlying purpose of writing the poems this way. Kaur does a great job of bringing out emotions from the readers, using pathos to make them understand. This is the strongest point of milk and honey and one of the reasons why I think so many people like this collection. She writes about many important ideas of feminism and being a woman and heartbreak. \n I read the whole novel as one really long run on sentence and just ignored all the breaks in the lines because I felt that they took away from the writing instead of added to it. Maybe if it wasn't abused so much, I would have enjoyed this collection more, but unfortunately it was just not my cup of tea (and honey). \n Nevertheless, milk and honey is poetic lines for the twenty-first century where our attention span is too short to watch anything that's not a six-second Vine or read anything that's not 140 characters or less and can be easily digested. \n This can be seen all around YA literature as more and more authors are throwing plot twists and adding unnecessary action or steam to novels just to make sure the readers are engaged enough to finish the book. \n Looking at the statistics, 50% of adults in the U.S. cannot read a book written at an eighth grade level and 45 million are functionally illiterate and read below a 5th grade level (Literary Project Foundation). This shows the changing dynamic of what people are reading and what they can read. \n Despite it's chopped up style made for easy digestion, Kaur's work is great for preparing people who don't like poetry to read poetry. It's easy to read and can really make someone fall in love with emotive words. After you read milk and honey, try to read some of the more traditional poetry works, like Robert Frost's works, and have your mind blown. \n I think part of the hype surrounding milk and honey comes from how aesthetic it is with its line drawings and minimalistic style and the simplicity of the words. This is definitely what lures a lot of people in because of its pretty cover and drawings, but on a more literary standpoint, it does not make poetry. \n As much emotion as I felt reading this, I can't say I enjoyed it. I think Kaur works really well with emotions on a page, just not with the actual literary aspect of it. I just can't get as into the poetic lines as other people when I'm trying to ignore the voice saying that this isn't poetry or asking why this line is broken up. I think Kaur has a lot of potential, but this Tumblr style writing is just not my favorite thing to read. \n There are still strong messages about feminism, relationships, family, and other serious topics which make this a novel choice suited for older teens & adults. Kaur shows the importance of these well, and I know this appeals to many people. \n I unfortunately would not recommend milk and honey to someone looking to read poetry. I would recommend it for someone looking for an aesthetic collection of prose that can be interpreted at almost any reading level (though the subject matter is not for kids). You can get into poetry without having to cut it up with scissors to make it easier to read, you just have to find the poet you like reading and go from there. \n This is just my opinion, so please be respectful! \n Blog | Instagram | Twitter","date":"2017-07-30"}

I'm actually able to understand both sides which makes it difficult for me to decide whether I liked this book or not. \n On the one hand, I'm impressed with the writer's bravery and her view on the world. It's her story, she shares in a very vulnerable way and that makes the content of this book untouchable. I really think people can find comfort in her words and I'd have to lie if I said it hadn't moved me as well. \n On the other hand, I agree with those who couldn't find much poetry and new aspects in this book too. Half of the pages in this already very short book were filled with aphorism more than real poems and some of them sounded a bit like things you heard of before. \n Furthermore, I missed a clear order in the poems. Sometimes the poems felt like put in order randomly. I'd have liked to see a well-defined thought-process. \n Nevertheless 3,5s for a book that I read because of hype, but surprised me anyway.

{"book_id":"1420","rating":5,"review_text":"Hamlet \n Genre: Drama \n Autor: William Shakespeare \n Verlag: Fischer \n Preis: 8EUR \n Seiten: ca. 150 \n ISBN: 978-3596900343 \n 1.\tHandlung: Im Mittelpunkt der 1602 uraufgefuhrten Tragodie steht Hamlet, der junge Prinz Danemarks, der aufgerufen ist den Mord an seinem Vater zu rachen. Mit Intrigen versucht Claudius der unrechtmassige Konig den Thron und seine Ehre zu retten. \n 2.\tSchreibstil: Wie ich bei Klassikern immer sage: Ich bin keine Fachfrau und kann deshalb nur als Laie bereichten. \n Versform und epische Form wechseln sich ab. Man muss naturlich Zeit investieren dieses Buch (Theaterstuck) zu lesen, da wir heutzutage diese Sprache nicht mehr gewohnt sind. Man kommt also nicht drum herum Abschnitte doppelt zu lesen und auch mal das Internet zu rate zu ziehen. \n 3.\tCharaktere: Die Charaktere waren sehr interessant und jeder hatte seine spezifische Rolle zu spielen. Vor allem Hamlet faszinierte mich mit seinen ausschweifenden Monologen. Auch die Geliebte Ophelia durchlauft eine grosse Entwicklung. Die Charaktere versuchen sich gegenseitig gegeneinander auszuspielen und ihre eigenen Ziele zu verfolgen. Daraus ergeben sich allerdings auch Opfer er Rankespiele. \n 4.\tUmsetzung: Die Tragodie besteht aus 5 Akten, bei denen der 5. Der finale und entscheidende ist. Der Erste dient als Exposition. Der Spannungsbogen spannt sich nicht nur daruber sondern steigt stetig, bis er abrupt endet. Man kann kaum atmen so sehr fesselt die Geschichte durch diesen Aufbau. \n 5.\tCover: klassisch Klassiker \n 6.\tEnde: Das Ende war einer solchen Tragodie passend. Naturlich nicht in allen Einzelheiten beschrieben, da es ein Theaterstuck ist. Aber eben noch hochdramatisch und endgultig. Danach folgt ein meiner Meinung nach charmanter Ausklang mit einem Hoffnungsschimmer. \n 7.\tBewertung: \n 1.\tHandlung: 30 / 40 \n 2.\tSchreibstil: 15 / 15 \n 3.\tCharaktere: 18 / 20 \n 4.\tUmsetzung: 10 / 10 \n 5.\tCover: 3/ 5 \n 6.\tEnde 10/ 10 \n 8,6 / 100 \n Gesamtwertung: 8.6 P \n Genrewertung: 9 P \n An dieser Stelle mochte ich noch einmal eine absolute Empfehlung aussprechen fur dieses Buch wenn man mit Klassikern anfangen mochte oder auch mit Shakespeare. Das Buch ist relativ kurz und man kann selber entscheiden wie tief man in die Materie eindringen mochte.

I won't comment on the religion, because that's not exactly my purview. \n I think I would have enjoyed it more if I were a medieval Italian - or at least, if I understood any sort of Italian. As it is, I read the translation by Jean & Robert Hollander, footnotes and all, and these saved me many a time.

{"book_id":"1715","rating":5,"review_text":"Best book ever. I don't know if I will every read anything better than this. It is a great and most diverse collection of stories - gods, voyages, love, war, woeing, incest, adultery, rape, revenge, unrequited love, jealousy, philosophy. You name it, Ovid has stories for them all told in most poetical manner (some of the poetical narration is still there despite the loss in translation) with only similarity that at least one thing changes form to be another in each of them. \n As to crew of characters, we have Zeus, Apollo, Athena, Saturn, Neptune, Pluto, Muses, Aphrodite, Pygmalion, Cupid,Pythagoras,Hercules, Achilles, Ulysses, Narcissus - to name a few. \n I have tried my best but this book is beyond the best of review I can give. \n Must read.","date":"2016-08-04"}
{"book_id":"1371","rating":5,"review_text":"I first met Greek gods in 'Hercules' the animated cartoon series, which I loved watching as a kid. Then there was Wikipedia and then Ovid's Metamorphosis. My point being I really had high expectations when I started reading Iliad. I expected it to be a more complete account - beginning with 'Apple of Discord'; may be even before; then Paris' judgment that Venus was fairest of three goddesses, then oath taken at Helen's father's place and then Helen's seduction or rape (whichever version you prefer) and only then war. I was also expecting it to end with the whole Trozen horse story. What it actually turned out to be was a few macho guys fighting over some Greek blonde. \n There are a lot of characters just there to die or kill and the fact that characters are often refered as son-of-this, son-of-that leads to confusion. Moreover, Achilles is such a cry baby - 'Mamma, Agamemnon stole my girl', 'Mamma, Agamemnon insulted me', \"Mamma, I won't fight', \"Mamma,. Hector killed my friend', 'Mamma, I'll fight', 'Mamma, I drown!' and so. \n Gods and poetry \n What made it work for me was the poetry in it. By making the divine interference the rule of the day; Homer Simpson makes a very clever use of gods, using their names to stand for forces they own - God of war constantly changing sides, sea calamities being wrath of Neptune, heavy rains or storms being wrath of Zeus, warriors felling prey to Apollo's arrows and so on. \n My favorite is the conversation between Venus and Helen. Helen reproaches Venus for deceiving her by coming to her as a servant: \n Then is it still thy pleasure to deceive? \n And woman's frailty always to believe! \n Look at the other meaning in the reproach. She is remarking on the way beauty would decieive a woman in belieiving she is there to stay. Venus reply is equally poetical: \n Should Venus leave thee, every charm must fly, \n Fade from thy cheek, and languish in thy eye. \n Cease to provoke me, lest I make thee more \n The world's aversion, than their love before; \n Now the bright prize for which mankind engage, \n Than, the sad victim, of the public rage. \n Also he is incredible in his portrayal of gods. Forget the little cat fight between goddesses; just look at how he gave Zeus that godfather like coolness of a powerful figure by talking about power of a simple nod from him: \n He spoke, and awful bends his sable brows, \n Shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod, \n The stamp of fate and sanction of the god: \n High heaven with trembling the dread signal took, \n And all Olympus to the centre shook. \n Hero-worship, not so much \n 'And for the king's offence the people died.' \n It is kind of difficult to know what Homer really thinks of war. While he is constantly talking about achievements of warriors and who-killed-whoms (which got boring for a while when Zeus made that no-divine-interference law); he seems at same time showing the stupidity of whole thing. May be, he didn't do so more directly as it might have meant reproaching ways of his own society: \n \"For I must speak what wisdom would conceal, \n And truths, invidious to the great, reveal, \n Bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise, \n Instruct a monarch where his error lies; \n For though we deem the short-lived fury past, \n 'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last.\" \n A pacifist might not have been favorite of people even in Homer's own time. So he probably had to mask his arguments. \n None of the heroes are without defects while heroes of opposite side - especially Hector are presented in as good light as his own if not better; which is not the kind of treatment expected from a hero-worshiping bard. We have talked about Achilles' who looks like a spoiled child of god rather than anything else; both Hector and Ulysses are shown to be fleeing from battle grounds at least once. \n Achillies ' choices to quit and return to the war are both taken under anger rather than thoughtfully. He even forgot the oath he had given to Helen's father when he decided to quit. \n Also, Homer would remind you that physicial strength is not the only virtue that a man possess. Virtues like physical strength, ancestory etc. which bring honor to individual; are repeatedly shown to be matters of fate rather than merit. \n When Achilles quit the war for a while, he made quite a few good arguments as why one shouldn't fight (reminds you of Arjuna at beginning of Bhagwad Gita). In fact, his choice from among destinies offered to him - a long prosperous life or glorious death of a hero; forms the key theme of book. I personally don't think he chose smartly. \n Also it is ended when characters are mourning for Hector. Her wife's laments are the most moving words throughout the epic: \n \"The day, that to the shades the father sends, \n Robs the sad orphan of his father's friends: \n He, wretched outcast of mankind! appears \n For ever sad, forever bathed in tears; \n Amongst the happy, unregarded, he \n Hangs on the robe, or trembles at the knee, \n While those his father's former bounty fed \n Nor reach the goblet, nor divide the bread: \n The kindest but his present wants allay, \n To leave him wretched the succeeding day. \n Frugal compassion! Heedless, they who boast \n Both parents still, nor feel what he has lost, \n May the lucky one win \n Anyway one point that Homer makes clear beyond any doubt is that victory has nothing to do with such silly things like bravery, courage etc. It is all about fate and (divine) connections. The ultimate fight between Hector and Achilles (who could have already been dead - a couple of times, was it not for gods) is a mere formality; gods won't let anything to happen to Achilles, it could only end in one way. \n 'Tis man's to fight, but heaven's to give success \n Hector is in fact the one who comes as true hero - presented in best light, choosing to fight even when he knows that he stands no chance (despite making a number of other blunders). The third mourner over his dead body was Helen, whom his brother had kidnapped. He had reproached Paris for his stupidity in kidnapping Helen and for cowardice he showed in duel against Menelaus; but never reproached Helen for their miseries - which is very opposite to what other Trozens (except the king and Paris) did. His reputation is purely based on merit and it is so good that even gods who were teamed in killing him wouldn't let his dead body be insulted. \n \"Prayers are Jove's daughters, of celestial race, \n Lame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face; \n With humble mien, and with dejected eyes, \n Constant they follow, where injustice flies. \n Injustice swift, erect, and unconfined, \n Sweeps the wide earth, and tramples o'er mankind, \n While Prayers, to heal her wrongs, move slow behind. \n Who hears these daughters of almighty Jove, \n For him they mediate to the throne above \n When man rejects the humble suit they make, \n The sire revenges for the daughters' sake; \n From Jove commission'd, fierce injustice then \n Descends to punish unrelenting men.\"","date":"2016-08-04"}
{"book_id":"1381","rating":4,"review_text":"Much like Achillies in Iliad, Ulysses is to be frequently seen weeping in Odyssey. With Achillies, it was always question of honor, with Ulysses, it is matter of home-sikness. He had all comforts when living with Calypso and yet, much like Dorothy, he too feels that there is no place like home. \n I like the episode in Hades the best. The knowledge of the fact that his mother died while he was far away added to his misery but I think there is a poetical element in there too - for don't we deal with death without dying ourselves when our loved one dies. Haven't we all feel scared of losing our loved ones when we are not far away from them? \n Homer uses the episode to take stock of a number of dead characters. Also, it is in Hades that we meet dead Achillies who seems to be regreting his selction of honor over life: \n \"I would rather be a paid servant in a poor man's house and be abpve ground than king of kings among the dead.\" \n ... which is very opposite to what Satan said in Paradise Lost (Better reign in hell...) \n Many of his troubles are invited by Ulysses on himself when he arrogantly gives his name to Cyclops Polyphemus. The name 'Ulysses' means trouble - both causing and facing. An early example of this behavior from him is given in by that mark left on his body by that boar he hunted. Although he is cunning enough to survive all those troubles. \n After going through several adventures (songs of sirens,Circe's magic, sea monsters etc.) he finally makes it to home, but not to finally have rest after this long journey. Rather his house is in chaos - friends had turned foes when he was away and he must beg around in his own house. You know how it feels when you return home tired after a long working day only to find that you still have to make your bed before you can fall asleep. Now imagine the feeling increased by a zillion times: \n \"Be strong, saith my heart; I'm a soldier; \n I have seen worse sights than this.' \n Even after all this he was still lucky - to have gods in his favor, he has too much served to him on plates by different gods (especially that Minerva who can't help playing guardian angel) to be likeable; and to find that atleast his own family was faithful to him. Compare this to fate of Agamemmon who came back home only to be murdered by his wife and her lover. That might look cruel on part of his wife, but he himself had come back with Casandra, the woman he had kidnapped from Troy. So, you see it is difficult to feel sorry for these Greek heroes. \n Agamemmon is right in thinking that Achillies'fate was far better than him. It ceases being home when your family turns against you (which makes Penolope's faithfulness all more important) \n And if all the adventures and poetry is not enough, there are some love stories goung around, best of all was Nausicaa's unconfessed love stays in mind long after her story met an abrupt ending: \n \"Lovely Naussicaa stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of clositer, and admired him as she saw him pass. \n \"Farewell stranger,\" said she, \"do not forget me when you are safe at home again, for it is to me first that you owe a ransom for having saved your life.\"","date":"2016-08-04"}

I think it's so well loved by the internet because a lot of people relate to it, but I'm definitely not one of those people. All of the poems follow this theme of love, heartbreak, and a little bit of family and culture too, and while these are topics can be ones that connect humanity, I feel like they were too simplistic and clear cut to have much of an impact on me. However, there are a few poems that really did stick with me in a weird way, and the art Rupi Kaur includes with each poem is beautiful.

There was pieces here and there that were amazing but over all it was kinda bland. However this could be because of how amazing the first collection was.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"This might have just been the most heartbreaking and true book that I've ever read. This also might be my new favorite book. \n Some parts of the book, mostly the chapter Loving, I could not relate it to myself. Still, I could empathize for Rupi Kaur, and I could see myself in that situation in the future. But the chapters Hurting and Healing... I have never seen myself that strongly in another book. It made me hurt a little bit, reading my soul in someone else's words, but I benefited from it. During Healing, several poems gave me advice to problems in my life now. \n It made me think as well. With the lowercase standard, the periods breaking up thoughts/sentences, and the art accompanying some of the poems, my mind was forced to go slower and process what Kaur was saying. That was refreshing. \n I was surprised by how fast I began loving this book. You see, even as I am an avid reader, poetry was something that I always distanced myself from. Poetry, to me, is connotative to long, boring, confusing pieces that I wouldn't be able to comprehend. The only poetry I've ever been able to enjoy is the work of Shel Silverstein, though it is written for children (I love it nonetheless). \n I've heard a lot of people trashing this style of poetry -- coining Kaur an \"Instagram poet\" -- but I don't really see why. I love it. As I said in the previous paragraph, it's the first \"real\" poetry I've ever found enjoyable. \n I said earlier this week that I hoped that Salt to the Sea would reintroduce me to my love of reading.

It's a little bit different when he uses characters from Celtic mythology- at least there, there's been less cultural lionization to put up with.

{"book_id":"1715","rating":5,"review_text":"\"My purpose is to tell of bodies which have been transformed into shapes of a different kind... and spin an unbroken thread of verse\" - from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" \n Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", first published in 8 AD, is sometimes considered an epic, an epic poem, mythology, legend, or even a fairy-tale or a piece of folklore. Most have agreed that this literary work defies genre. \"Metamorphoses\" encompasses all the literary descriptions listed above, and is essentially a world-building composition that tells over two-hundred and fifty stories of transformation - transformations of mortals and gods alike - into elements of nature such as plants, animals, and other phenomena. Ovid, born in 43 BC, is an Italian storyteller, and today, it is still a mystery as to why he died in exile from Rome. His \"Metamorphoses\" contains re-tellings from the Latin and Greek tradition. \n For most people who read this text, a lot of names will be familiar, such as the goddess Diana, Hercules, Arachne, King Midas, Apollo, Narcissus, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Athena, Anemone, Icarus, Achilles... and more. These names have been remembered by modern artists and poets, filmmakers, and publishers of comics and other media. Besides the characters themselves, some of the stories prove more revealing than others, particularly because of their English-language counterparts. Arachnophobia, for example, which means a person's fear of spiders, is echoed in a story about Arachne, an extremely talented weaver, who was challenged to a weaving contest versus the goddess Athena, also known for her art of weaving. Arachne won the contest easily with her intense and beautiful work of art, and of course this angered the goddess Athena. Arachne hanged herself, but Athena made her live on as a spider, in punishment for her arrogance and talent. So too is the echo of narcissism, which is synonymous with extreme vanity. Narcissus, the son of a god and a nymph, was extremely handsome, so much so that he scorned everyone who fell for his beauty. The goddess Nemesis punished him for his scorn by guiding him to a river where he finally saw his own reflection. Upon doing so, he fell in love with himself, which was an eternal torture for him because that love could not be reconciled with a mere reflection. For these names and their stories, \"Metamorphoses\" offers a strong foundation for many abstract and concrete concepts encountered daily. \n Fascinating tales such as those are presented throughout the \"Metamorphoses\", and they often depict both human and godly passion, whether love, lust, jealousy, anger, guilt or any other that drives them to do abominable things, heroic things, magical things, or amazing things. There are transformations as blessings to give freedom from pain, such as a human becoming hawk. There are transformations born of pain, such as the sufferer who becomes a river or lake. There are transformations of punishment, such as man into oxen or cow. There are sinful, abnormal emotions that rise from the darkest parts of the soul; a sister madly in love with her brother, or a daughter who lusts after her father. The stories that come with these are painful and often nauseating, and very believable. There are enchanting love stories, such as the story of a man, unimpressed by the women he met, who carved his own statue of a woman which was so gorgeous and lifelike that he fell in love with his own creation. Praying to the gods, he asked for a woman like his creation. Instead, the gods granted his wish by making his statue real. There is the story of Ceyx and Alcyone, mortals who turned into real love birds. There is the story of the maiden Caenis, who was given the blessing from the gods to become a man in order to escape rape. There is the house where Rumor lives, with all her doors and windows open the year round. There are battle scenes with such unimaginable violence; a mother killing her son for food, unaware that is was her son turned animal by the hands of the gods. \n Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", translated from Latin into English, might be difficult for the contemporary English-speaking reader (as it was for me). But Ovid's thick descriptions and enchanting poetry carry through centuries and centuries withstanding all language, cultural, and historical boundaries, fresh as ever. There are battle scenes with such violence that perhaps might have only been regarded for television audiences in the 21st century. However, the big difference is in Ovid's scenes - they take place in a land bountiful with natural landscapes, natural food, the wilderness, the heavens, unending earthly resources, mineral wealth, clear skies and clear waters - which is a place always worth remembering.","date":"2017-07-04"}
{"book_id":"46199","rating":5,"review_text":"Usually, when someone directly asks me what my favorite book is, I say that I haven't yet found it, but I love many. This is no longer true. Letters To A Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke is now my favorite book, and although I am not an artist, reading it compelled me in such a way that other books have only made me contemplate. Rilke's Letters To A Young Poet encouraged me to change; my opinions, my fears, and my actions. Rilke asks Kappus, the poet he is writing to, not to neglect his emotions, but to feel them, however wonderful or painful, and to turn \"inward\" in his search for truth (first letter). Rilke also reminds Kappus, in another letter, that beauty can be found in everything - such as, if one had an unhappy childhood, there are things, perhaps even things special to a certain individual, to be found in memory that, if missed or searched for, will bring peace and humility (sixth letter): \n \"try to be close to Things; they will not abandon you; and the nights are still there, and the winds that move through the trees and across many lands; everything in the world of Things and animals is still filled with happening, which you can take part in; and children are still the way you were as a child, sad and happy in just the same way and if you think of your childhood, you once again live among them\" \n There are ten poems collected in this book, each one speaking of a different part of life. I read it once through, and a few hours later began from the beginning and started to read again. Never has a book made me want to read it a second time, *without delay*. If possible, this will be a book that I will keep in my bag or purse wherever I go. \n The ten poems were written in the early 20th century. It is a mystery how unparalleled the writing is, in terms of applicability in the 21st century; Letters To A Young Poet, in short and maybe needless to say, is a work of art.","date":"2016-12-05"}
{"book_id":"139004","rating":3,"review_text":"Emerson is an American prophet and is the genius behind the Transcendentalist movement. He foresaw the spiritual renaissance, the direction that America was heading in and was ahead of his time in how he saw religion (as opposed to how the masses saw it) as were all the Transcendentalists with him. Unfortunately, his writing suffers from his overwrought style. It just does not hold up and is cumbersome, very difficult to get through. Where his genius really comes through is where it is tightly woven, like in a perfect sentence or group of sentences, where his writing becomes austere and wise. I also love his response to the Abolitionist movement, which is that he thought that it mattered not if society changes, but the individual does not change.

{"book_id":"1381","rating":4,"review_text":"Being not that great with reading poetry, I chose to pick up prose translations of Homer's great epics before moving on to the verse translations. For the Iliad, I'd read E.V. Rieu's excellent translation. Of the Odyssey the edition I read is the translation by Samuel Butler. It was fairly easy read (but still took me longer than I'd expected to finish). Butler's translation uses some Roman equivalents for the pantheon (as well as for Odysseus) but retains one or two of the Greek as well, which I found a bit odd, though it didn't interfere with my reading. \n The story itself is lighter in tone and atmosphere than the Iliad, which of course was heavy with the atmosphere of war and death. Odysseus (or Ulysses, as he was in this version) has his share of trials and faces dangers but these are more along the lines of an adventure. One of the things that surprised me was how much of his journey we hear from him after it's happened (in a 'flashback' of sorts) rather than going along with him as it happens. (The adventures themselves were fun reading, especially since I'd read Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters just last month, which has many of these woven in.) \n What I enjoyed the most was the many facets of everyday life that one could see (no doubt of the upper end of society)--particularly hospitality to guests, that they were received and treated with food and drink before the host could ask them their names or purpose, or not letting them leave without giving gifts (sometimes the best things they had). \n There were, as there are in any society, all variety of people, the brave, the noble, and the dishonest but ultimately in Homer's world, it is the gods who determine all--it is on their whims that things happen and people act as they do. So what I was left wondering was how one should understand/assess our heroes and even the villains, when may be not all of their actions are entirely their own, but a game the gods are playing.","date":"2017-01-03"}

{"book_id":"1715","rating":5,"review_text":"This is one of the four classic heavy weights of ancient heroic poetry (along with Homer's The Iliad & Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid). The poem stretching to 634 pages was written by Ovid 43BC-18AD for Rome and Augustus. It brings together many myths and legends from Greece and Rome including Daedalus, Pygmalion (made into My Fair Lady), Perseus, Hercules with characters like Cyclopes, Centaurs, Circe, Apollo and the usual gods and people used to name moons. I read the hexameter poem translation and this worked really well for me; it included a detailed summary introduction to each of the 15 books and an index of characters/places (25 pages about #500 in total!), notes and a map. The poem has had a major impact on western literature. It does have reference to various incest (father-daughter, sister-brother etc), cannibalism, murder-revenge and war, lots of women avoiding or being raped and blasphemy. It has humorous notes but is otherwise a relatively serious entertainment. \n The poem works to bring the many ideas of time, mental and bodily change and karma (gods punish to match the crime etc) to the human condition. It starts with creation (and has a flood event) and ends with the deification of the Emperor. So apart from getting under the skin of ancient religious world view, broadly I could see how such a then contemporary work (which already embraced Greek to Roman god correspondence) could parallel the intellectual development of early Christian understandings of the transformation and transformative nature of a man to human-god entity by the authors of the New Testament or indeed how texts can metamorphose to religion and how religion can them metamorphose into a justification for killing. Interestingly the book contained a passage on vegetarianism (and not to kill for sacrifice); it also seemed to have very few non-human transformations i.e. vast majority are people to birds, rivers, trees etc. \n A couple of quotes \n \"you credit the gods with too much power if you think they create and then alter the shapes in Nature\" \n I love this poetic description of Rumour:- \n \"Picture a space at the heart of the world, between the earth, the sea and the sky, on the frontiers of all three parts of the universe. Here there are eyes for whatever goes on, no matter how distant; and here there are ears whose hallows no voice can fail to penetrate. This is the Kingdom of Rumour, who chose to live on a mountain, with numberless entrances into her house and a thousand additional holes, though none of her thresholds are barred with a gate or a door. Open by night and by day, constructed entirely of sounding brass, the whole place hums and echoes, repeating whatever it hears\" \n \"The centaur then bounded forward, trailing his guts on the ground; as he trailed them he trampled them under his hooves; what he trampled he burst till he caught his legs in the sludge and fell with his abdomen empty\" \n \"Helen weeps too when she looks in her mirror to see her old woman's wrinkles, and wonders how she came to be twice abducted. Time, the universal devourer, and spiteful decay, there is nothing you cannot destroy\". \n A vast, educational, legendary, pleasurable rock of Western literature.","date":"2016-04-15"}

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":5,"review_text":"I read Brown Girl Dreaming by Jacqueline Woodson. It won a Robert F. Sibert Medal for non-fiction. \n Content area cross-over: History, because it talks about what it was like for her growing up in the 60's and 70's as an African American girl in different parts of America. \n Bloom's Taxonomy Questions: \n 1. Remembering: \n What are the names of Jacqueline's brothers and sister? \n 2. Understanding: \n Write about one main idea you think the story has and why it is important. \n 3. Application: \n Using what you read, describe Jackie in three words. Use examples from the text to support each word. \n 4. Analyzing: \n Compare Jacqueline to her sister, Dell. How are they alike? How are they different? Use evidence from the text to support your answer. \n 5. Evaluating: \n Do you think Jackie had a good childhood? Explain why you feel that way. \n 6. Creating: \n Rewrite the story from Jackie's mom's point of view. \n The answer to number 3: \n I would describe Jackie as a tomboy, caring and creative. I think she is a tomboy because she writes about herself as a tomboy, and says she loves things like kick the can and racing, while her sister likes to read. On page 211, she has a poem called \"tomboy\" where she refers to herself as a tomboy. One reason I think Jacqueline is caring is because she loves her grandfather so much and when he is sick she is the only one of her siblings who wants to take care of him. On page 235 she explains while her siblings are outside playing she is taking care of her sick grandfather, stating, \"His room smells, my sister says. But I don't smell anything except the lotion I rub into my Grandfather's hands. When the others aren't around, he whispers, you're my favorite, smiles, and winks at me, you're going to be just fine, you know that.\" I also think Jacqueline is creative because she is always talking about telling stories, writing a butterfly book and even writing a song about mountains. On page 176 she says, \"It's hard to understand the way my brain works - so different from everybody around me. How each new story I'm told becomes a thing that happens, in some way or another, to me...!\"","date":"2017-06-11"}

{"book_id":"732562","rating":5,"review_text":"Rating: 5 / 5 \n The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a classic poetry book from the pen of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In my interpretation, this seems to be the story of numerous zombie mariners, and the story of how they became the way they are, and the things that happened to them all afterwards. I really wanted to read this again for my own entertainment after remembering randomly one day that I read this back in secondary school. I had really loved it then and I really wanted to reread it and give it my full attention and to revisit something I had previously loved so much. I found it for free on the Kindle Store and immediately dived into it. \n When I first read this, I wasn't a great lover of poetry, and I loved it then. I still love it now, years on and I will continue to love this for a long time to come. I would recommend this to everyone and anyone. \n The words flow so simply and so easily over the pages, I was hooked and had finished it before I knew it. I think it took me about 15 minutes to finish this poem? It was spectacular. Coleridge's control over language is stunning and it created vivid images in my head. I couldn't get enough of it and I'm tempted to read it all again once I post this review. It was absolutely beautiful and I can't wait to read this numerous times over my life.

{"book_id":"96259","rating":3,"review_text":"As much as I love the way Siken writes his verses and lines, so much emotion pouring out onto the paper, I can't quite wrap my head around the long verses with no breaks. His words make me think, it really makes me think about things in my life, and situations going on, and they even help me sometimes to think of it from a different way. However, I get a headache trying to focus long enough reading more than one poem at a time. I love the way Siken writes, I love the words chosen, how his choices seem quite bland but when all put together they make such a strong, powerful statement, I just can't focus. \n I'm not sure if it's because I'm reading a free PDF online (uploaded by a library within the public domain), or if it's the way a lot of the poems seems to be bunched up, but I do wish I could have settled down and just read this from cover to cover. \n I recommend this book, if you're a fan of poetry, but if you're not someone who can sit down and just enjoy a poetry book no matter what, you might want to give this a tentative try. Siken has amazing talent, it's just a shame it's talent that's hard to follow.","date":"2016-10-04"}

{"book_id":"1381","rating":5,"review_text":"Odisea es uno de mis libros favoritos, el que sintetiza la gran mayoria de los topicos y de los temas que pueblan diariamente las novedades literarias. Es una de las obras fundantes de la literatura occidental y como tal, todo lo que se compuso, se transmitio y se escribio despues de ella va a tener su sello de manera indiscutible. En este relato epico podemos encontrar los grandes conflictos humanos (que existieron antes, que existen ahora y que van a perdurar en el despues dado que son inseparables de la condicion humana) matizados con la intervencion externa, por la presencia de dioses y del Destino, lo que tambien hoy forma parte de la cotidianidad de la totalidad de la raza humana (algunos creen en Dios, otros en distintos dioses, muchos otros se refugian en el destino o la suerte, etc). \n El argumento es ampliamente conocido por lo que no veo sentido a colocarlo en esta resena, pero si me interesa destacar como la historia del viaje de retorno de Odiseo (o Ulises) podria ser considerada una gran alegoria de la vida humana, de los desafios que todos y cada uno de nosotros enfrentamos en nuestra busqueda de sobrevivir al mundo. Muy probablemente este no fue el sentido que Homero (?existio realmente el poeta Homero?) le dio a su obra, pero creo firmemente en el hecho de que el lector debe apropiarse de lo que lee, debe incorporarlo a su vida para hacer de ese tiempo de lectura un tiempo de construccion personal. Nuestra vida se mide en tiempo, por lo tanto, cada segundo que usemos para algo debe ser una inversion. \n Para mi leer Odisea fue adentrarme en las raices, ponerme en contacto con la tradicion ancestral, con nuestra historia como civilizacion, saber que si hoy puedo leer \"X\" obra literaria es porque existieron esos primeros poetas que marcaron el arte del relato, de la narracion. \n Les dejo uno de mis pasajes favoritos, el cual no ha perdido vigencia para nada: \n \"Es de ver como inculpan los hombres sin tregua a los dioses/ achacandonos todos sus males. Y son ellos mismos/ los que traen por sus propias locuras su exceso de penas\" (Canto I vv. 32-34) \n Este es un clasico que hay que leer y releer a lo largo de las diferentes etapas de la vida.","date":"2016-09-16"}

Like any sacred text, it shouldn't be read literally, but with the understanding that there is a pervasive message. In this book, Arjuna is encouraged by Krishna to follow his calling and to not deviate from it in any way. One of the things that's always stood out for me in this book (I've read it several times over the years) is that Arjuna's attachment to blood ties is corrected by Krishna, as Krishna emphasizes the importance of defending your blood ties because they do right . . . not because they are blood. Defending blood ties for blood's sake leads to wrong-doing. There's a lesson in that, I think! Anyhow, no matter your faith tradition, this is a rich story worthy of reading.","date":"2017-08-09"}

I also don't like my original review of it, so I would like to write an updated one. \n Milk and Honey is one of those books that make me wish I was a writer. I am an artist, I can draw, paint, make collages, etc. I am an artist, but not a writer. I have never been able to create the right string of words to properly explain my emotions in a relatable and beautiful manner. Rupi Kaur has mastered this. Having gone through a painful break up myself, Rupi articulates all of the complex layers of love and hate in a withering relationship... it made my heart ache. Intimate to it's core, Milk and Honey is a chorus for broken hearts, and those healing from it. I would consider this as a good starter for someone deciding to read poetry as it's easy to understand. I docked one star however, because as much as I enjoyed the book, I was disappointed with part four 'The Healing'. I didn't find it be as strong as the other parts, and actually thought it was corny.

These so-called deep poems are nothing more than pseudo-complex oneliners. They are tweets and instagram posts being presented to us as poetry . \n And this girl is not a poet in any way. Per Example, there is a poem which is: \n \"fall \n in love \n with your solitude\" \n What happened to the proper form of: \n \"fall in \n love with \n your \n solitude\" \n Another poem goes like this: \n \"i was music \n but you had your ears cut off\" \n Which is blatantly lazy writing. Hey, genius, you can still hear with your ears cut out, it should be \"but you had plugged your ears\", which would make more sense. Not to mention what an utterly narcissist statement it is. \n And that's all this book is, a series of short, narcissistic statements with oddly placed line breaks and all-lower caps to create the illusion of poetry. And maddeningly, an whole page which holds maybe ten words, so Kaur is not only killing poetry with her trash but also the trees. \n Rupi Kaur knows nothing about poetry. She's not either experimental either, and to break the rules, you need to know them properly. \n She reminds me a lot of Bukowski, who also was a mediocre-at-best poet with absolutely no understanding of metre or technique, a rank amateur who mostly got by on his personality, but at least he made the occasional attempt to craft a beautiful image or original thought. He usually failed but it was still sincere failure and sometimes even demonstrated effort and creativity. It wasn't the sloppy, cliched and self-satisfied poetry of Kaur, which is written to service her own self-image as an \"artiste.\" Bukowski wasn't just a great big act of self-promotion and propaganda with no absolutely intelligent thought whatsoever given to craft or beauty. \n What actually offends me though, is the websites claiming that \"every woman needs to read Kaur\". No. Absolutely not. By stating that, you are offending me as a reader of poetry, you're offending poetry itself by stating that Kaur can even be compared to actually good poets and perhaps most egregiously, you are offending every woman with actual taste that chooses her favorite poetry on it's actual merits and not on whether she happened to born with a vagina instead of a penis by implying that simply being woman she would be in any way attracted to this dreck. \n Kaur is so intellectually dishonest/artistically lazy it's way past self-parody now.","date":"2017-05-27"}

I read lengthy excerpts of the Odyssey in the Homeric Greek when I was in high school (I was a Classics geek). Homeric Greek compared to Attic Greek (the language in which Plato wrote his Dialogues) is like Chaucer is to modern English. That experience impressed upon me the fact that this story is thousands of years old - it's like looking at the growth rings of a giant redwood with a 20 foot diameter trunk - and yet has endured unmatched in all of that time. My most recent reading of this book was the T. E. Shaw a/k/a T. E. Lawrence (more famous as \"Lawrence of Arabia\") prose translation from the mid-1930's which is both true to the original and compelling in its own right. Entire libraries of interpretation and criticism have been written about this poem and its influence on the literature of the human race. It has inspired Vergil and Jung. Our concept of a mentor comes from the Odyssey (see Addendum, below). The rough justice Odysseus metes out to the suitors of Penelope makes the end of \"Taxi Driver\" seem like a pillow fight. But far be it from me to put my two drachmas-worth in on this work. All I will say is: if you haven't read the Odyssey, you haven't lived. \n Addendum: And, by the way, Homer was a feminist. That's right. Notwithstanding the testosterone of the hero and his doomed crew, there are numerous strong women figures (including goddesses and demigoddesses) - Athena, Circe, Calypso, Queen Arete and her daughter Nausicaa, Penelope of course, and Mentor. Mentor? Yes. Mentor was the \"old man\" in Ithaca who counseled and comforted Telemachus, Odysseus' son, during Odysseus' absence. In reality, Mentor was neither \"old\" nor a \"man\" at all, but the goddess Athena in disguise. Ah, the irony!","date":"2016-12-08"}

{"book_id":"1519","rating":5,"review_text":"\"But a man's lifeblood is dark and mortal. Once it wets the earth what song can sing it back?\" \n Tragedy is described by Aristotle as \"An imitation of an action that is admirable,complete and possesses magnitude.\" (Poetics 4.1). However the Greeks had a radically different interpretation of what constituted admirable action than we do today. This brings us to today's work, Aeschylus' Oresteia. \n Considered the grandfather of tragedy, Aeschylus' masterpiece is the only surviving trilogy from antiquity; a rich and layered cycle of violence and its consequences that still feels fresh and vibrant today. \n The first play, Agamemnon, centres on the brutal murder of the eponymous King of Argos (Also the leader of the Greek army in the Iliad) by his wife, Clymenestra. The second play, the libation bearers, focuses on his son's quest for vengeance, whilst the third, the Eumenides, utilises the setting of a trial to discuss the moral ambiguities inherent in the climaxes from the previous pieces. \n It is this final play that transcends the whole piece into more than just revenge tragedy. The Trial of Orestes, Agamemnon's son, creates an environment where the morality of vengeance is laid bare and the virtues of law over violence are discussed. \n However the predecessors also have a part to play in the overall effect. The dramatic tension boils over in the first two plays, and particularly when Orestes confronts his mother in the libation bearers, to a nauseating degree. Furthermore the initial murder that sparks this cycle of violence is not unprovoked, leaving the audience to decide who they should side with. \n Overall, the work is a measured and developed contemplation on violence, revenge and justice. It provides a unique insight into the Greek views on morality and righteousness and makes for thrilling drama. \n Check out my blog at \n http://mikesliteraryhistory.wordpress... for more reviews.","date":"2016-07-26"}
{"book_id":"1371","rating":5,"review_text":"\"Two fates near me on to the day of death. If I hold out here and I lay siege to Troy, my journey home is gone, but my glory never dies. If I voyage back to the fatherland I love, my pride, my glory dies...true, but the life that's left me will be long, the stroke of death will not come on me quickly.\" \n Such is the dilemma at the heart of the Iliad, one of the greatest stories ever told. Allegedly written by a blind poet called Homer between 710 and 760 BCE, though some dispute he even existed, it tells a story of honour, revenge and fury set 10 years into the legendary Trojan war. \n The protagonist is Achilles, the greatest of all Greek warriors and the man who has to choose between a mortal life or immortal glory. He is a fascinating character whose admirable physical prowess, making him a highly prized asset to the Greek army, is at stark contrast with his stubbornness and impulsive anger. \n Other engaging characters include: \n -Agamemnon; the war hungry general leading the Greek assault on Troy \n -Menelaus; his brother who seeks revenge for his wife Helen eloping with the Trojan prince, Paris. \n -Odysseus; the crafty Greek commander, and king of Ithaca, who will become the protagonist of Homer's other epic poem, the odyssey. \n -Hector; the noble prince of Troy who is concerned with honour in battle and incurs the wrath of Achilles. \n -Priam; the aged king of Troy, who pleads with Achilles in a scene of sublime tenderness. \n The gods also feature heavily in this story, treating the mortal characters like pieces in an elaborate chess game. They include Zeus, Poseidon, Apollo and Aphrodite. \n The Iliad is an all encompassing look at Greek culture that shows readers their warfare, burial rites, sacrifice to the gods, the splendour of the nobility and more. \n Beyond it's historical value however, lies an excellent and timeless story. The brutal descriptions of war and the meditations on death add a philosophical quality and the depth of the language, even in translation, shines through. Truely one for the ages. \n For more reviews, check out my blog at \n https://mikesliteraryhistory.wordpres...","date":"2016-02-01"}

{"book_id":"1371","rating":4,"review_text":"For nearly three thousand years the poems of Homer have thrilled listeners of every culture and epoch. Allusions to The Iliad and The Odyssey are so pervasive in our western culture that they are almost required reading for anyone who wishes to study western literature. --- Diane (tm) \n Briefly, The Iliad is the story of the ten year long Trojan War, which climaxes with the destruction of the city of Troy by the Greeks through the deception of the Trojan Horse. Filled with tales of the heroes and gods of ancient Greece, Homer's poems are noted for the masterful use of wonderfully illustrative similes and metaphors, which become all the more wonderful with the understanding that Homer is believed to have been blind! \n Translations of Homer which try to adhere to the original poetic structure and be as literal as possible are immensely difficult to read by all but the most focused scholars. Other translations have completely deviated from any resemblance of poetry in an effort to be more accessible to the average reader. Here Mr. Fagles has achieved a translation which is not only easy to read and understand, but which retains the poetic lyricism of the original. \n Homer's works should be on the bookshelf of anyone who is interested in the classics, and with this translation you don't have to be a University Professor to appreciate them.","date":"2017-01-12"}

It is a journey and a manifesto connecting not only the struggles of women but people everywhere. Her illustrations opened my mind as much as her poetry and brought the shorter poems more meaning.

{"book_id":"6656","rating":3,"review_text":"In finally sitting down and reading the entire Divine Comedy, I can now see why The Inferno is usually separated from Purgatorio & Paradiso. The Inferno is captivating and paints vivid pictures of what Dante &. Virgil are seeing and experiencing. However Purgatorio & Paradiso seemed to lack this each in their own way. Purgatorio was still able to paint the pictures but not quite as vividly. Perhaps the subject matter was not as captivating as well. Dante certainly had the gift of making Purgatory feel not too bad but also not too good. In Paradiso we switch guides from Virgil to Beatrice. It is then that Dante seems to loose his focus on his surroundings and turns toward fauning over Beatrice's beauty. I figured that the Canto with God in it would have been a bit more powerful & profound. Lucifer's appearance was more awe inspiring than God's. Don't get me wrong, I give credit to the absolute classic that this work is, however I think there are some issues with it from a reader's standpoint. When all of the action is over in the 1st portion of the book it becomes a chore to finish reading it. All-in-all this entire work was beautifully written in the terza rima rhyme scheme which adds a bit of romance to every line read.

I never felt like I was listening to \"poetry\" but it all had a kind of flow that worked for each short snippet of memory. I am not sure how this would appeal to children, but to a white woman who also grew up in the 60s, this was a trip down memory lane. It made me think about my own childhood and the part that family, religion, and school teachers played. She describes a life both extraordinary and ordinary, both different and familiar to my own. I never felt distanced by her experiences as a black person growing up during the Civil Rights movement, or her memories of racism. I was more struck by how universal her experiences and memories were, and I think anyone reading this, young or old, black or white, will find much to relate to. \n Book description: Raised in South Carolina and New York, Woodson always felt halfway home in each place. In vivid poems, she shares what it was like to grow up as an African American in the 1960s and 1970s, living with the remnants of Jim Crow and her growing awareness of the Civil Rights movement. Touching and powerful, each poem is both accessible and emotionally charged, each line a glimpse into a child's soul as she searches for her place in the world. Woodson's eloquent poetry also reflects the joy of finding her voice through writing stories, despite the fact that she struggled with reading as a child.

But The Odyssey is also gripping and truly moving in parts. It's also bizarre: the book's obsession with food almost rivals my own, and its bloodthirstiness rivals the most excessive cinematic violence. Of course there's gods and spirits and the underworld and it's river Oceanus, but what's weirder than all that is the wily, arrogant, eccentric hero Odysseus. He is a very strange protagonist, in some ways a very traditional hero (strong, brave, honourable) but he also has an interesting relationship with the truth, best described as 'giving zero fucks'. He lies almost pathologically, weaving intricate backstories to hide his identity constantly. At first it's with strangers and the rationale makes sense, but by the end he is lying to his wife and father seemingly just because he enjoys his own powers of imagination and deceit -- appropriate for the oldest fiction in existence.","date":"2016-02-25"}
{"book_id":"15997","rating":4,"review_text":"I have to give this four stars because it is brilliant. I will admit though, there were times when it was very hard to pay attention and my mind wandered a bit. Read this for the beautiful, wonderfully written passage where Satan is actually in the Garden talking to Eve. That part is my favorite because the dialogue between her and Satan is intriguing. He begins by flattering her, really appealing to her, and it's easy to see how he manipulated her. You feel like you are there in the garden. If only the entire poem was like that. I didn't like how Milton shifts the end and talks about Noah and the Floods. I wish it was just focused on that one scene in the garden, but what do I know, Milton was a genius.","date":"2016-02-11"}
{"book_id":"34080","rating":2,"review_text":"T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land is one of those works intentionally designed by its author to be a literary labyrinth, so crammed full of references to other things that the explanatory notes dwarf the text itself many times over. But my calling it a \"literary labyrinth\" is misleading, as the phrase implies that you'd have a chance of navigating The Waste Land if given enough time. That is false. In his notes, Eliot writes of the three of staves tarot card \"I associate [it], quite arbitrarily, with the Fisher King.\" So you see, even if by some miracle you were well read in exactly the same way Eliot was well read, familiar with Dante, Herman Hesse, Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, translated Buddhist sermons, 1912 popular music, etc. ad infinitum, you'd still be at a loss to say exactly what's going on in The Waste Land because some of this stuff Eliot is just making up. It's a mystery wrapped in an enigma written in a cypher that Eliot invented, and thus it's a type of work I hate. \n I'm okay with a work that is a riddle on one level (I have in mind Gene Wolfe for prose, and the more opaque works by Dylan Thomas for poetry), but that on one level is key; there has to be something to fall back on if the labyrinth proves unnavigable. John Crowe Ransom writes of The Waste Land \"I do not know just how many parts the poem is supposed to have, but to me there are something like fifty parts which offer no bridges the one to the other and which are quite distinct in time, place, action, persons, tone, and nearly all unities to which art is accustomed,\" a description I agree with wholeheartedly. Of those fifty parts, a few could stand alone as enjoyable poems, but for the vast majority that's not true, the riddle is the be all and end all of most of the text. So because the riddle didn't do it for me, The Waste Land as a whole didn't do anything for me. \n I'd recommend Joyce's Ulysses to people who liked The Waste Land, and vice versa. I dislike them about the same, Ulysses has more going on beyond the literary labyrinth level, but it just goes on and on and on and on and on. At least The Waste Land is mercifully short. If you are going to read The Waste Land despite my review (and I know many people like the work very much, so don't let me dissuade you unless your tastes are similar to mine) the Norton Critical Edition is a necessity. In said edition 20 pages is the poem and the other 300 is notes, excerpts from sources, Eliot's statements about the work, critical reaction to the work at the time of its publication, and both old & new literary critique. The notes and source excerpts are essential, and I always get a kick out of reading how people reacted to what is now a canonical work upon its release. Not every work benefits so much from the added material included with a Norton Critical Edition (Pride & Prejudice, for example), but if you're venturing into a maze of a text like The Waste Land, it's the type of edition you need.","date":"2017-07-19"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"Current poetry trends are changing. A nameless amalgam of words taken in the context of a \"post-internet\" world, the current contemporary poetry movement has transcended the movement of words on printed paper. From micropoems embedded into tweets, text posts on Tumblr tagged with \"alt lit\", and words framed into Instagram's trademark square, a generation of young poets have taken to familiar forms of media to express their works. But to me, this isn't even the most defining thing about poems from the new generation. The notion that current poetry trends can be reduced to social media experimentation is cheap--it undermines the real literary substance of the movement. No, I think the most defining thing about current poetry is its transparency. It is raw honesty, \"new sincerity\" as termed by some. \n Kaur's collection of poems, titled milk and honey, articulate this perfectly. \n Fragmented into four chapters, the book's synopsis describes each segment as focusing on different kinds of pain. However each progressive poem in her body of work embodies a variation on a theme: different kinds of love, different kinds of loss, different kinds of power. The segmentation itself is a quiet kind of agency, one that implies \"seasons\" to each kind of emotion. This isn't to say that the whole thing can't be taken as a whole, however. It's imperative to consider the emotional journey Kaur takes the reader through, a cohesive picture which is every way compartmentalised as it is whole, not unlike the rhythm of our lives. \n Like others in the current poetic movement, (and I suppose, as a trend of humanity), Kaur deals with ideals of femininity and female empowerment through the current era. But in some sense, to dismiss these poems as a feminist collection isn't quite enough to capture the breadth of the words she's put into these poems. What Kaur drives home is the softness of femininity, and the power behind that. It's done in a way that is natural and without gimmick. It's written honestly, simply, softly, the latter of those words a recurrent motif weaving musically, quietly, in many of her poems. \n A short personal interlude here--this is the start of my own poetry week, in which I study and dissect contemporary poems from the current era. I decided to start with Kaur's book for various reasons, mostly because I've seen it been tossed around a lot. \n What I found most compelling about the collection is how its motifs slowly revealed themselves to you. It took me halfway into the third chapter before the lyricism of the book's title opened up to me. It took me up until that point to realise that there are different contexts in which honey could be placed. \n The first context is the crudest one. The book doesn't make light of this, Kaur draws it in her sketches, makes it synonymous with a thing to be coaxed, \"to come\". \n The second is the spoken--\"honey\". It's an endearment and a belittlement both. \n The third is the obvious one. The promised land, in biblical verses, is said to be \"flowing with milk and honey\". It is not wealth in the monetary sense, but in the fulfilment sense. \n The fourth and last is a metaphor for sweetness. This is the fundamental thing this book exudes, culminating to a touching love letter to the reader at the end. \n In many ways, milk and honey is poetry of its time. Although it's hard to look objectively on a movement that is in very many ways fluid and growing, Kaur's collection is an honest picture of a generation that is relying on women encouraging each other. In the light of recent political events and the success of the recent women's day marches, Kaur's brand of feminine sweetness is a powerful reminder of the agency of femininity and the beauty of a collective womanhood.","date":"2017-01-22"}

I absolutely adore the old, magical poetry that literally transports you to another world in your mind, but the way this was written was refreshing almost. The fragments of sentences, the illustrations, even the whole aspect of writing poetry not only to captivate an audience, but to heal your own heart, it all goes to show that there is no definite formula to writing poetry. I think that to say this is not 'true poetry' is complete nonsense, as poetry is viewed through one's subjective interpretation. Poetry is literally defined as the expression of feelings and ideas that are given intensity by the use of distinctive style and rhythm (thanks Google haha).

Ils sont tous la, dans le livre! Et quand tu l'ouvres tu n'es plus seul. Tu es avec eux, tu es... comme eux! \n Voila que j'ai alors compris quelque chose d'essentiel : Les Fleurs du Mal, ca nous envoute parce que ca nous parle de nous, ca nous tend un miroir et ca voit meme au fond de l'ame.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":1,"review_text":"This isn't going to be a positive review, fair warning. \n I don't enjoy this type of prose in general, but this book particularly tested me. A lot of it read as those scribbles you wrote in the corner of your books when you're thirteen and in love. \n \"My name sounds so good/ french kissing your tongue.\" \n I tried though. I really did. However, I had to draw the line somewhere, and apparently, this is where the line was at: \n \"That's the thing about love, it MARINATES YOUR LIPS.\" - ACTUAL PHYSICAL QUOTE. \n Guys. \n Please. \n I had high hopes for this. The first section was actually not bad - not amazing, but a solid foundation. I always highlight things that I like, and I even thought to myself that this was rather /unhighlighted/ as my readings usually go. \n It was a slippery slope after that though. It felt like the author decided that real life was too boring and they needed to explain how to be in love with a boy while not wanting to be in love with a boy in the most dramatic way they could. Let's just //forget// the first section of the book entirely and focus on romance. Often with lines such as \"I was music but you had your ears cut off\" or \"I was art but you weren't looking\". (I'm not quoting verbatim here anymore, I can't make myself open the book again, but you get the gist.) \n I looked for the author later, hoping it was a fluke, but judging from a peruse through their Instagram, their work really does read like the later parts of this book. So, I'll have to give it a pass for their next release. I wish the author all the best though! (Please refrain from marinating your lips again).","date":"2017-09-09"}

{"book_id":"6656","rating":5,"review_text":"The Divine Comedy is one of those timeless pieces of literature that everyone should read, if at least once. In fact, if public schooling followed any type of common sense and had appreciation for High Culture, The Divine Comedy would be part of a strong school curriculum along with classics such as The Iliad & The Odyssey, The Lord Of The Rings, The Aenid, and others. \n Each of those books makes learning about virtues, and countless other themes vastly more interesting than the nonsense that is espoused in education today. Furthermore, it would strengthen the public schooling curriculum that is rather lacking in depth, although not in 'method'. \n Due to those reasons, and others, thought it prudent to avail myself of The Divine Comedy as the prospect of reading the book has always resonated with me, especially after having read Dante's Inferno a few years ago. \n The Barnes & Noble Edition of The Divine Comedy is as demanding a read as it is satisfying. Moreover, the book is peppered with dozens of Gustave Dore's illustrations, which saliently add a more vivid and engrossing journey for the reader. At times, the neophyte reader might need a dictionary handy to clear up some confusion, but otherwise it's readable at least. \n In contrast, Dante's Inferno, the version that was translated by Stanley Lombardo, is a much more reader-friendly version of this piece, which is modern in its diction and poetic in its presentation. That said, that is only book one of Dante's triumvirate, but I am mentioning for those that might be interested merely in the opening salvo of Dante available in a much simpler format. \n The Divine Comedy really is an adventure to be intellectually enjoyed, and everyone who chooses to set out in a fictional foray would benefit greatly from it. \n As an allegorical account of his spiritual journey being guided by his lover Beatrice, Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy is timeless for a reason. Not only is the book unique, but it stokes the engines of imagination in ways most other books do not, while also offering readers ample intellectual considerations to ruminate upon.","date":"2017-06-30"}
{"book_id":"15997","rating":5,"review_text":"Paradise Lost by John Milton is a veritable landmark book within the chronicles of humanity's past. \n Milton's imagination was as boundless as it was incisive, and he paints a masterful world in which good and evil battle for the fate of the world. \n Undoubtedly one of the best epics of all-time, Milton's Paradise Lost, features a plethora of allusions the likes of which haven't been replicated since, and just might not be replicated ever. \n Milton's constant inferences to theological and classical underpinnings of society are one of the greatest components of this masterpiece. Every line is incisively thought out, and weaves seamlessly into the next manifesting a masterpiece of literature that's as thought-provoking as it is deep. \n The diction used in Milton's time might be something that could turn certain readers off, but the notations at the bottom of each page of this particular version help the reader traverse through this fascinating and fierce fictional world that Milton crafted rather seamlessly. \n Admittedly, an epic like this will demand a lot from the reader, and rightly so. It's a quintessential milestone in history. \n Given the complex range of characters it employs [Adam, Eve, Satan, God, Michael, etc.] and fuses with philosophical underpinnings of what many of humanity's deeper yearnings and concerns are, only helps catapult this work beyond the rest in its field. \n Ruminating upon its breadth, scope and complexity, it's a pity that more works aren't as well thought out as this. The standards Milton set upon himself to accomplish this piece should be held in high respect, for it is a testament to what human creativity can achieve when it sets its mind to it. And that is priceless, just like this book is.","date":"2017-02-13"}

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":4,"review_text":"Poetry was popular in 2015 with the Newbery committee. The Crossover won the Newbery Medal and Brown Girl Dreaming won the Newbery Honor. \n Discussing the latter book, I think it's a beautiful picture of a young African-American girl growing up during the tumultuous times of the civil rights movement. It's disgraceful that even 50 years ago, people could be denied service because of their skin color. It's astonishing to see that discrimination through the eyes of someone who experienced it firsthand. Woodson's memoirs are, for the most part, lovely, though the book feels a bit disjointed at sections. She is outstanding at describing details of everyday life, including her experiences as a Jehovah's Witness. \n I enjoyed the little touches Woodson's writing had, such as the phrase \"Coraandhersisters\" appearing frequently (Woodson's grandmother said the phrase so fast it sounded like one word). Mostly, I loved how real the civil rights movement and the Jehovah's Witness lifestyle came alive through Woodson's writing. \n Though it's a bit hard to follow for younger audience, I recommend Brown Girl Dreaming. It's a unique experience in free verse and culture that certainly deserved a Newbery Honor, and I definitely want to read more of Woodson's work.","date":"2017-01-17"}

To me this book did not read like poetry since it was all about her life. I know other poetry books such as Gary Soto's A Fire in My Hands is about his life, but I guess this book seemed to have a deeper connection with me because it was during a time of struggle. In both Second Daughter's Second Day on Earth, Jacqueline Woodson mentions some important names and wondered if she could ever compare to them. Would she grow up to be like James Baldwin, Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, or Ruby Bridges. All of those people she mentioned in that poem all contributed something amazing to the civil rights movement.

But boy, was I disappointed. \n I can get behind Rupi Kaur's politics and message one hundred percent, but that does not mean I'm going to sit here and pretend I considered any of this to be poetry. This felt like literary fast food. Milk and Honey stands as a sort of written representative of a powerful social movement, but she leaves much to be desired from a purely literary standpoint. In essence what Kaur is saying in this collection is commendable, and on some level it is great that its resonated with so many people. But to me, the poems of Milk and Honey are things which most anyone could pick up a pen and write without much skill or attention. There most certainly are artists and poets who are politically aligned with Kaur and who could do a much better job, and receiving the ideas presented in Milk and Honey with some amount of depth and aesthetic would make for a much more meaningful and provoking reading experience. There is not a sentence which lingers, nor an image that seized me in this collection. \n The hand-drawn images were to me the only saving grace of the book. They were quite charming and gave my mind something to do while reading. But even at that, they almost seemed to be plastered there to distract from the drab quality of the writing.

{"book_id":"6656","rating":0,"review_text":"Dante's Divine Comedy, read it rather fast-paced for it was almost like a duty after reading Ulysses and after becoming aware of all the reference by artists i like. I can see why, rather remarkable considering when it was written. Reading it with few interruptions for close readings did not seem such a bad move though I felt bad sometimes. If you get struck with every name and check out the historic reference that is made it will take you a very long time. If you ignore them it seems that it is easier to get a sense of the whole that this text seems to be constructing...i read a German version from 1966, at times the translation worked marvellously. Guess for the final parts of the book to be effective one would need to read the Italian/Latin version though...the representation of paradise seems to work largely on using a different tone, as Dante refrains from any explicit notions of the state of paradise, always telling that reader that words could not do justice to what he witnessed...I seem to remember that Las von Trier made a cynical remark about that in an interview: Dante finds it so easy to figure suffering and pain but so hard to do the same for the qualities supposed to be found in paradise..tells a lot for him about the thing we call \"life\".","date":"2017-04-20"}

{"book_id":"18003300","rating":3,"review_text":"Look, I quite liked much of the content in Love and Misadventure. I liked the feelings it generated, I liked its whimsical nature, and I liked the structure of the collection. My problem was with the structuring of the poetry itself and that I paid for it. In the poems being so 'simple', and so, so brief, they didn't feel like poetry. There was little to be explored or developed, and they seemed, at times, quite basic. \n The strength of the collection, however, lies in the prose passages, and I think Leav's skills lend far more toward prose as in Love and Misadventure than what has been labelled here as 'poetry'. Those pages were far more pleasurable to read and felt like the kind of content meant to be published, shared, and enjoyed. While the other poems may generate some kind of emotional response, they were too elementary for me to reconcile spending money on them. \n Sidenote: it really bothered me only having one 'poem' per two pages. They were so short as it was, it seemed like such a waste of paper.","date":"2017-02-08"}

I wanted to see what all the hype was about, and I think that it got so popular because the writing is simplistic and it's very easy to understand what she's talking about. Subjects such as abuse (incest?), healing from that, loss, heartbreak, feminity, acceptance, self love, etc are universal and can apply to everyone (not the abuse but the rest of it at least). \n I read someone recommend this as mandatory reading in high school, I maybe wouldnt go that far.. college definitely but high school is a bit early for this type of eroticism (chapter 2 especially). I definitely was reading worse at that age but of my own free will, not at the hand of a teacher.

{"book_id":"15645","rating":4,"review_text":"Inferno is a rather interesting poem, even more when you take into consideration the various motives Dante had for writing it. One of the foremost reasons was partially revenge on propaganda against his political enemies. Dante's native city of Florence, Italy, was in political turmoil at the time of writing Inferno. Two warring clans, the Guelphs and the Ghibillines, alternatively ruled Florence. As a Guelph, Dante's clan suffered a defeat around 1301 which caused him to be banished from the city. As backlash, he published this poem in which he placed several of the dead Ghibillines in various circles of hell. The poem is actually set before Dante's banishment, so some of the spirits he speaks to foretell this event. \n Also, Dante was a very religious man, so the theme of this book revolves around religion. The tactic Dante uses is a sort of \"scared straight\" idea. By describing the horrors of those who sinned, the reader is frightened into not doing those things. Even those who are neutral in religion are punished in Dante's Inferno; They are chased around endlessly by swarms of wasps, forced to follow a bright banner held by the fastest of them. The wasps represent the evil ideals tempting them and the banner is heaven's glory: \n As soon as they enter, Dante hears innumerable cries of torment and suffering. Virgil explains that these cries emanate from the souls of those who did not commit to either good or evil but who lived their lives without making conscious moral choices; therefore, both Heaven and Hell have denied them entry. These souls now reside in the Ante-Inferno, within Hell yet not truly part of it, where they must chase constantly after a blank banner. Flies and wasps continually bite them, and writhing worms consume the blood and tears that flow from them. \n The poem is both a description and a narration. The events go in chronological order; Regardless, Dante was a master poet, so he goes all-out in terms of detail and descriptiveness. He even tells at what time of day he reached each circle of hell. The sinners are what he reserves his most intense and, at times, coarse language for. It seems that he holds sinners in such low regard that he feels comfortable swearing about them. \n Overall, I found this book intriguing, to say the least. I wasn't particularly enthralled with it, but I cannot begin to describe Dante's mastery with words. He is very blunt and graphic, but that is what the poem is supposed to be like. He wanted people to be horrified at his work so they would then be scared of sin. I suppose in this way it would have been easier for someone to relate to the story in its time. The translation was excellent, and the footnotes and index assisted my comprehension. \n Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review: \n In the middle of the journey of our life I found myself within a dark woods where the straight way was lost. \n There is no greater sorrow then to recall our times of joy in wretchedness.","date":"2017-03-08"}
{"book_id":"1420","rating":5,"review_text":"I'd been meaning to read Shakespeare's books since I began studying the English language. Unfortunately, I had to wait some years to start, because Shakespeare is not the easiest of authors to read. Well... better late than never - and there is actually no late when it comes to reading books. This is the second book I read by William Shakespeare and I am happy I finally did. I have no patience for modern versions, so I threw myself directly onto the originals. Fortunately, I hadn't any idea of what the plot was about, so I had an awesome time reading it. \n What I enjoyed the most about this book was Shakespeare's diversions. When Laertes says towards the end: \"I do receive your offered love like love / And will not wrong it.\", I thought that the story would end happily. Silly me. I learned the hard way that nothing is what it seems when it comes to Shakespeare. It's incredible his ability to weave seemingly unrelated events and make you feel like an idiot when you finally find out what is what. \n After reading this, I am happy that I am no longer ignorant when somebody refers to a story as a retelling of Hamlet. I mean, there are many books that are retelling of this and other Shakespeare plays, then it is nice not to be left guessing, right? Nothing beats reading the original and then seeing how the copycats fare. \n Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review: \n There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. \n There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. \n Conscience doth make cowards of us all.","date":"2017-03-08"}

Because of this some are tempted to see Whitman as a poet of pure exuberance--like a proto-hippie or, worse, like a garrulous Hallmark card. But Whitman doesn't shy away from pain at all--he embraces it like he embraces everything else--not in a way that cheapens or ignores it but in a way that feels it deeply too. He did, after all, endure the civil war (he served as a nurse in army hospitals--we might shudder to think what those were like) and wrote about the experience in his typically direct, personal way. \n Speaking of the personal, for many years I always brought an old tattered copy of Whitman with me backpacking, and whenever I had to endure a particularly awful commute, I'd listen to Whitman to calm down, to step outside myself and encounter something beautiful amid the soul-crushing traffic.

{"book_id":"15997","rating":5,"review_text":"I still have my old grad school copy of this work, earnestly annotated with references to Ovid and Homer and (once) Terminator 2. But through all that Milton's words shine forth, depicting the struggle between good and evil, which is a struggle precisely because Satan is so alluring and interesting (by far the most interesting character here, which of course didn't escape the notice of later Romantic writers who were themselves drawn to the anti-hero). But the struggle isn't just between mythic forces, but within the human heart itself, which is what gives the work its under-girding of tender sadness--like the outcry of the \"Portress of Hell Gate,\" who laments in Book II: \"Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem / Now in thine eye so foul, once deemed so fair / In Heav'n....\" It's a tale of loss (obviously) and jealousy and narcissism (cue the Ovid references) and it's really quite unexpectedly heart-breaking at times, though I'll admit the poetry can be dense and difficult and full of allusions, which is perhaps why it didn't become a \"classic\" until a few decades after publication when someone produced an annotated version.

{"book_id":"23919","rating":5,"review_text":"I've reviewed the tales I read by their individual titles, and I won't repeat my reviews here. Let me just say that Poe is an under-appreciated master. Not just under-appreciated by many readers today, for whom he's synonymous with being a sort of proto-schlock-horror writer, but under-appreciated by readers and even famous writers of his day. Henry James infamously said that \"[a]n enthusiasm for Poe is the mark of a decidedly primitive stage of reflection.\" Granted, James was young at the time, but still, that's no excuse. Even worse was Ralph Waldo Emerson's dismissal of Poe as the \"jingle man.\" These writers (whom I otherwise admire) thought of Poe as immature, but I think they make the classic mistake of confusing the writer with his subject. Poe's characters are often high-strung and immature in their way, but Poe is never without an ironic distance from them. Many of the narrators of his tales are classic \"unreliable narrators,\" and Poe wants his readers to see them as such--to see behind the masks they don--and it's there that his tales gather most force.","date":"2017-04-25"}

{"book_id":"1371","rating":4,"review_text":"Listening to the Iliad I realized just how much I vacillate. If I lived then would I have been a Greek or a Trojan? I can see both sides: obviously Helen was abducted, but Menalaeus saw her as a prize, not as a wife, and, therefore, was probably not his only one. Greece was known to invade and vanquish territories surrounding them. This just gave them an excuse. Troy defended themselves valiantly. Their army was not the same size as Greece, but they had a mighty walk that could not be breeched without trickery. \n This debate then leads me to think about who was the mightiest warrior. Obviously the choices narrow to Achilles and Hector, but what made Achilles so powerful was his mother's intervention, his staff from Chiron, his five-layered god blessed armor. Hector was mighty because he was a true determined hero. \n I see a reflection of Greece's ancient domination in Russia's dominance in Eastern Europe during WWII. It was a constant taking of territory and turning the people to a new way of life, destroying whatever is in the way or defies control. \n Lessons can still be learned from the Iliad. Lessons of honor, trust, loyalty, respect, determination \n For an alternative perspective check out The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller or Helen by Margaret George.","date":"2016-08-12"}

{"book_id":"23919","rating":5,"review_text":"Edgar Allan Poe's stories are excellent and it is hardly surprising that many have had very good film and TV adaptations. They are the stories that stick in your mind *even when you don't want them to*. Edgar Allan Poe had a fear of premature burial for example. Anyone who has read his tales will now share that fear to a greater or lesser extent. \n The close and strange relationship between the brother and sister in The Fall of the House of Usher creates a narrative which stays with the reader. This is helped by the \"texture\" of the language used in the tale. The way he presents the tales is at least as important as the (sometimes groundbreaking) content. \n Read it late at night when you are alone in the house :)","date":"2016-02-20"}

It seemed to me that Siken was starting to write a poem and then used a linear thinking process but there was no end point to reach, it just kept going until he felt that the poem was good enough to randomly stop. I mean, some of the poems were good, but looking back at the book I can't remember which specific ones stood out to me. So, were they really that good? \n It was simple to read in terms of an easy vocabulary, but it was hard to grasp regarding the \"deeper meaning\". Besides the obvious suicidal thoughts, ruined love, blood, knives, guns, and such dark things, I did not find a deeper meaning. Maybe this is because I am not much of a poem reader?

But make no mistake, her poetic voice comes through loud and clear. Arranged in seven parts, she has collected events and encounters in the life of American citizens, and arranged them to vividly portray the experience of black people, and especially black men, in America today. \n Rankine describes incidents ranging from the slights that friends and acquaintances make without realizing they are making (\"What did you just say?\") to the blatant racist language and violent stereotyping we see all too often in the media. All are treated in vivid prose and accompanied by provocative artwork - a image of a street sign designating Jim Crow Lane; a tennis star who stuffed her tennis outfit with towels front and back to imitate Serena Williams. Included in this volume are scripts she has written to accompany \"Situation\" videos produced with her husband John Lucas, a documentary filmmaker. Some of these videos can be viewed in various places on the internet. (Search for Situation video).

It reads like a young woman's diary, which is most likely why it got the traction it did via social media. \n Overall, I wouldn't regard the work as poetry, as Rupi's style consists of clumsy lines and a proclivity for \n writing \n everything \n like \n this. \n I tried to make some sense of it, with my limited AP Lit knowledge, but I concluded that it was all just very arbitrary. \n Did I enjoy it as a survivor? As a woman of color who's had her heart smashed to bits? Yes. \n But not as a lover of poetry.","date":"2017-07-25"}
{"book_id":"1420","rating":4,"review_text":"Hamlet is by far one of the most complex protagonists known in English literature. His motives are understandable, yet his mad behaviour to cover up his actions is cunning. I don't think any normal human could be capable to act half as good as Hamlet does throughout the story. The way he is able to convince everyone, including his mother, that he has gone mad, is impressive. However, I think Hamlet should have taken his mother aside and explained everything. That may have changed her view on how the Danish monarchy is now under the reign of her late husband's brother. \n Moving onto his King Claudius: he is up there with some of the best fictional antagonists. Though I do not quite grasp how he could be king if his late brother was king (and Hamlet the crown prince), I do find it interesting that he has this hold over Denmark because of his position. I'm sure if Hamlet had succeeded his father, Claudius would have had to flee Denmark in order to not be executed, as the ghost of Hamlet's father may have turned up either way. Who knows though, Hamlet might have then ordered a man-hunt or so. \n Though I did enjoy it, I do feel Shakespeare went too far in the ending with all the characters who die. \n To other readers who intend to pick up this work by Shakespeare, I do recommend you read it. Nevertheless, it is not an easy read, so do not think you'll be done with it on one afternoon. It could take you a while, not only because of the Shakespearean language, it also has to do with the long speeches sometimes, which you may need to read a few times to fully understand the message in some of them.","date":"2017-04-24"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"For once, I will write not one sentence about this book. I just have too much to say. \n BUT, I do love my traditions, so here's my little review for today: \n Don't take the journey to healing for granted, there's a lot more that comes with it than you might think. \n A little vague, but the book is kind of vague itself. And by that I don't mean that I didn't like it. In fact, I adored it, which is why I rated it 4,5 to 5. What I mean by vague is that it's poetry. It doesn't really have one big storyline behind it, like a novel would. You have to give it your own meaning. Poetry is a form of art, after all. \n Now I know that this book either gets the most wonderful reviews or the worst ever. I believe that's to blame on the fact that people just simply can't find a meaning in the pieces. They might not understand it completely, which is fine, I didn't either at all times. I think to really get the words, the book, the writer, you'd have to have been through a situation as Kaur herself. \n Some also comment that the book doesn't even contain any poetry, just some sentences or small fragments. That's complete and utter nonsense, because poetry, much like art, is something extremely personal. If you believe this to be poetry, then it IS. If you don't, well then, fine. \n For me, poetry (or art for that matter) has to have a certain meaning behind it. This does. And how. \n I have been highlighting, taking notes and reading this book over and over again. \n To the writer: such an accomplishment this was! I can't wait to read 'the sun and her flowers', hoping to find more feminine empowerment, amongst other topics there. \n 4,5/5","date":"2017-09-13"}

{"book_id":"15997","rating":3,"review_text":"I initially read this for a course at university, for pre-1800's literature. Unsurprisingly, Milton's epic poem was one of my favourite reads: fallen angels, self-inclined Eve, a righteous God. The famed sympathetic Satan is compelling, and I often caught myself agreeing with the ambiguous language of her character. Satan would definitely be a politician (or maybe not, as he is actually persuasive.) The challenge thrilled. \n Books 1, 2, 4 and 9 were the strongest among the 12 as God- or Adam-orientated books struck me as stifling and trapped within a religious rhetoric outlined by the Bible... which was probably pandering to the zealous masses at the time of publication. In fact, for a modern reader, I would recommend you read these books first, understand them, and treat the other books as optional. \n If I could change anything, I would ask Milton to get his head out his ass (sorry) with all the self-appraisal inserts throughout, as it just made me want to jump back in time and give him a slap. \n Overall, a compelling and intense read. If you're struggling with the language, I suggest you pay attention to the punctuation and consider how the enjambment may act upon meaning. Hint: Satan often places two metaphors next to each other, sometimes combined, so try to separate them out and you'll soon get into it.","date":"2017-05-14"}

That or I need to stick to novels. I just find that I never relate to any of this poetry. The writing does evoke emotion for me but what I like is when I feel that I can relate to what's being pondered upon and can visualize what they are describing, which never really seems to happen in these popular poetry books I keep seeing advertised. I maybe like 2-3 poems and that's it. \n In this collection, I found the doodles distracting and (maybe because I was reading this on my phone) I could not tell when one poem began and the other ended. \n All in all, I'm just not a big fan of poetry, specifically feminist poetry that focuses on romance, so that's why I didn't enjoy Milk and Honey.","date":"2017-10-02"}

Curious as to the appeal, I finally got a chance to read it. Reading it cover to cover will only take a half hour or so, but if you want the words to sink in, give yourself some more time. Teen girls, on the cusp of adulthood and college will eat this book up. It's mature story doesn't sugarcoat the bad and highlights the good. The story is told in four parts, mirroring the author's short twenty-one years of life. Told in verse, the stark storyline of rape, molestation, first love, sex, survival, and her relationship with her parents paints a bleak picture at times. The narrative voice is part stream of consciousness and part letter to the reader. Line drawing illustrations highlight certain verses. Depictions of the female body (again, in sparse line drawings), sex, and self-love might make some educators uncomfortable but to the mature teen readers, it will feel like someone is finally making them feel like an adult.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"As someone who is currently going through heartbreak and reminising over the loss of an ambiguous relationship, a lot of this poetry personally resonated with me. I like that the book is split into different sections ('Healing' was my favourite) and I enjoyed most of the artwork portrayed throughout the book. However, this book is an explicit read - just a warning for those who may not want to read about sexual relationships or abusive relationships (mostly emotional). \n I may be in a more vulnerable time of my life right now and so reading some of these words really had a powerful impact on where I'm at. Saying that, I still found a couple of poems were 'trying too hard' and seemingly trying to provoke a reaction just for the hell of it rather than being of substance. I also didn't like a couple of the messages of some of the poems - especially about needing to learnt to love yourself first before others can love you. I think that this is a harmful message and everyone is deserving of love no matter what your relationship with yourself is. I sometimes go through periods of depression and of hating parts about myself - does this make me an unloveable person? I question some of these ideas. \n This is a thought-provoking read that I am sure I will return to at a late time or recommend for someone experiencing heartbreak and wanting something to relate to and then to focus on the healing section for inspiration and encouragement.","date":"2017-02-20"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"It has been a while since I have read poetry just to read poetry, so when I came across this book I thought it would be a nice shift. In the beginning I was actually quite happy with the choice, but it didn't last long. (Great start: \n \"how is it so easy for you \n to be kind to people he asked \n milk and honey dripped \n from my lips as I answered \n cause people have not \n been kind to me \") \n There were a few poems that were quite remarkable, but the majority were just eh. As single standing poems, some of these could go quite far. But as a collection, the less spectacular draw down the few truly great. Also there was one in particular that really felt like it was trying to sound more poemy and in the process it stopped making sense. \"...you teach her to confuse \n anger with kindness \n which seems like a good idea \n till she grows up to \n trust men who hurt her...\" \n Why and how would that seem like a good idea? \n The poems were quite repetitive both in theme and wording. (\"I am a museum full of art but you had your eyes shut\" next section: \"I was music but you had your ears cuts off\") There was an overall progression of the theme from being hurt to healing, but the divisions (the grouping of the poems into the separate sections) made it feel like a disjointed progression; like experiences were pulled out of a timeline and shoved into boxes. Poetry does not need to have a progression or a timeline, but sometimes having one without the other gives it an off feeling. This was one of those cases. \n Overall, not recommended.

She shows the difficulties growing up in two areas, both of which present difficulties, but she doesn't dwell on the hardships. Instead, you see the closeness of her family, especially to her grandparents. You see her relationship with her mother, two older siblings and her younger brother.

{"book_id":"15645","rating":4,"review_text":"I have to credit Rod Dreher for planting in me the seed of desire for reading Dante through his book How Dante Can Save Your Life. When the desire blossomed I sampled several different translations (per Dreher's advice) before I landed on the translation by Esolen. Here are my thoughts on the poem itself, the translation, and the accompanying notes: \n The Inferno itself is an imaginative masterpiece that inspires both curiosity and revulsion. At times the descriptions are grotesque, but what else would you expect? Each canto (there are 34) is brief, which makes it easier to keep reading. \n The translation by Esolen is a delight to read. He is clearly an exceptional student of the English language. I cannot comment on his faithfulness to the Italian, but for those who can read it the Italian is on the left hand page throughout. Only occasionally did I wonder if Esolen was too harsh in his choice of words, but for all I know he was simply being faithful to Dante. \n No one is likely to make much sense of Dante's poem without a knowledgeable guide, but no one wants a guide who interrupts you every five lines either. Esolen's combination of footnotes and endnotes answers the problem admirably. Footnotes are rare and brief, giving you short but necessary aides in understanding Dante's poem. Each canto also begins with a brief summary of what will happen and who Dante will meet. In the endnotes Esolen provides much more detailed information for the curious or the confused.","date":"2017-06-06"}

{"book_id":"46199","rating":5,"review_text":"Never had a book with so few pages have such an impact on me. \n I started reading this book with the expectation of wrapping it up as soon as possible. But I ended up divided between two parts of myself: one part eager and driven through each letter by a hunger that had me finishing the whole thing in an hour. And another part prolonging for as long as possible, wanting to digest every letter and every word, hold its meaning closer to the heart and carve it deep into the mind. \n As a result I ended up reading every letter twice, three, four times over and over. And still I wasn't satisfied. \n You see, this book answers nothing and, YET, answers everything. \n Those letters are not just an advice to a young poet who doubts his own talent. Within its lines, hidden or taunting you in plain sight, are some of the most passionately moving words of encouragement and an addition into the life of not just an artist, but that of a human. The depth of what Rilke was able to express left me humbled, the way he expressed things that I had always felt twisting deep inside me, OR, I hadn't consciously felt before and yet knew to be true as soon as I read them, and thought inexpressible was both humbling and purely genius. \n The gentle, unimposing yet wise voice of Rainer Maria Rilke turned my thoughts inside out, and surprisingly became the best way to fold up one more chapter in my own life and open another.","date":"2016-07-27"}

{"book_id":"20613761","rating":5,"review_text":"Rankin is a national treasure - she speaks eloquently of truth, beauty, hatred and love. THis book was stunning in all aspects.Citizen is divided into seven sections. It has no table of contents nor index. The poems are without title. There is nothing given to the reader to ground her in any specific time, place, or frame. Rankine uses this lack of bounded-ness well as she weave her words in an out of a dream like existential world, which, she sharply illuminates with a sudden turn to a dark reality. \n is illustrated with a variety of art works. These serve to heighten the tension inherent in her voice; to make visible her words, as if her words were not sufficiently visible and striking. These pictures serve to extend the conversation she has and add depth to the feelings that have no name or bottom. The book is audacious in its form, being a clarion call to action. The variation of verse to poem left me surprised and drawn in to this work as one piece, rather than separate poems about racial justice and equality. Rankine all but screams from many of the pages, telling the reader to feel ashamed, frightened, furious about the larger social and smaller personal injustices suffered by Black Americans. One of her pieces (p. 49) asks the question \"what makes language hurtful?\" a particularly cogent topic to someone who deals in words. Rankine takes this theme and runs with it, unfolding the gift wrap on the box to reveal the empty box contained within. Not even an empty box, a box that does not exist, but is painfully present in its box-hood. She refers to \"language that feels hurtful is intended to exploit all the ways you are present.\" Instead of the invisibility of race, Rankine presents the hyper-visibility of race as seen in our \"language acts.\" This was a revelation to me; language as a way not to erase but to heighten the presence of an outcast group. \n Citizen's hybrid style of presentation is bold, cutting, and if you can handle it, accurate. She writes about the truths we try to shrug off or deny. Rankine takes what the world views as news and expresses it as the banal quotidian lived experiences of other (Black) people. She uses both politics and the prosaic insults inherent in the day of a (Black) citizen. And she speaks poetry. For example: \n \"Yesterday called to say we were together and you were bloodshot and again the day carried you across a field of hours, deep into dawn, back to now, where you are thankful for what faces, the storm, this day's sigh as the day shifts its leaves, the wind, a prompt against the calm you can't digest.\" (p.75) \n The soft hush, the warm breeze, the tension of this quiet backdrop is felt against the reality of a (Black) person's day. It is so evocative, of what? Therein lies the tension.","date":"2017-09-20"}

{"book_id":"82356","rating":4,"review_text":"Egeon, a traveler from Syracuse, travels to Ephesus in search of his missing twin son who he hasn't seen since the boy was an infant. However, since the cities of Syracuse and Ephesus are having a HUGE quarrel, anyone traveling to Ephesus from Syracuse is either 1. sentenced to death, or 2. must pay a thousand-mark fine. At the start of the play Egeon, has accepted his fate - death - but tells the Duke, or ruler of Ephesus, what he's doing there in the first place. The Duke, a compassionate man, yet one who must uphold the law, listens intently as Egeon explains he is looking for his long-lost twin son who he was separated from in a shipwreck many years ago. Touched by the story, the Duke gives Egeon until five o'clock that day to come up with the thousand-mark ransom - or die. \n So, a dark start to one of Shakespeare's earliest comedies. Yeah, this is a comedy. (Read the title.) \n The clock starts ticking down... \n This is a twin comedy, one in which twins run around doing things not realizing the other is there. The twins are named Antipholus of Syracuse (Anti of S) and Antipholus of Ephesus (Anti of E.) (Yes they have the same name.) Somehow, one of the twins ended up in Ephesus; the other has been raised back in Syracuse by Egeon. This is confusing enough, but Shakespeare needs to add another set of identical twins, Dromio of Syracuse (Antipholus of Syracuse's servant) and Dromio of Ephesus. (You figure out who he is.) Because they keep running into people who confuse them for the other, hilarity ensues. Anti of E is married; yet Anti of S runs into his wife, and she thinks - well you know what she thinks. (In a bawdier version of this tale, one which Shakespeare borrowed from, the wife goes to bed with the wrong Anti. Now that the Elizabethan audience would have loved. Wonder why Shakespeare left it out?) \n There's confusion over who took a ring from a courtesan, who owes a goldsmith for a gold chain - which was going to the courtesan but Anti E's wife thinks is for her. There's also Anti of S getting a nice meal meant for Anti of E, while the real Anti of E is locked out of his own house because well, everyone thinks he's already inside, eating his nice meal, right? There's confusion about getting a rope, and who owes a merchant money, as well as lots of master-on-servant beatings when the servants (Dromio S and Dromio E) talk to the wrong master, thinking it's the right one, yet getting orders and instructions all mixed-up. (There really is a lot slapping and hitting in this comedy. Slapstick!) \n It goes on like this with constant confusion between who is who with only the audience knowing exactly what is going on. \n I wondered how the stage directors of the time identified who was who, because if I was sitting in the audience I'd have been all mixed up. (I marked all the S people or Syracusians with a circle in the text - my own book - and the Ephesians with a square.) I also heavily re-annotated the annotations in my book and marked all the puns. \n And here's a problem with puns, we still think they're pretty funny today and if you doubt me, I can give a few off-color examples. But many of the pronunciations of certain words have changed. Take the word 'hours,' for example. Would we modern people ever think a word play with the word whores and hours might be funny? Nah, never, why would we? But in Shakespeare's day the words rhymed! So there you go, a whole lot of funny stuff goes right over our heads which the Elizabeth audience would have roared at. \n Luckily, my annotated version pointed this out, as well as the humor revolving around topical or historical events which we wouldn't get unless we're historians or something. Despite all that there's a lot of humor which still wears well and once the twins - the TWO sets of twins - get everything settled there's a happy ending here. \n A quick and funny play. I can see why it's retained its popularity over the centuries. And by the way, Egeon finds his missing twin; the Duke spares his life; and Anti of S gets a wife, which just so happens to be Anti of E's wife's sister. \n Get all that?","date":"2016-03-10"}

{"book_id":"2696","rating":0,"review_text":"The Canterbury Tales presented such a challenge that I used a dual-language version by Peter Tuttles to go through it over a course of several months. I was surprised by the variety of settings (with some locales in Russia and Syria), and amused by the vulgar nature of some of the stories. Not that it was completely unexpected -- Frances and Joseph Gies unintentionally introduced me to some of the medieval mind's bawdiness. Rather than being so presumptuous as to review Chaucer, I'm simply going to post excerpts from a few of the more memorable stories. \n ====================== \n Knight's Tale: Two cousins imprisoned together fall in love with the same woman, and are violently jealous even though they're in a tower and there is zero chance of them courting her. Naturally one escapes and the other is pardoned, and upon pursuing the girl they meet in a field and start fighting. Who should discover them but the king who imprisoned them in the first place, who -- persuaded by the girl, who turns out to be his sister -- allows them to meet one year hence, with their respective armies, and enter into trial by combat to see who shall win her hand. \n The moral: Finders keepers. \n The Miller's Tale: One woman is pursued by two men while still married to a third. The story involves two occasions of rear ends being kissed by mistake. \n The moral: Wait until daylight to kiss people. \n The Clerk's Tale: A King is pressed by his people to marry and decides to marry a beautiful and virtuous peasant. Despite her character, wisdom, and beauty, the King is constantly suspicious of her and inflicts a series of Job-like tests upon her which amount to (1) making her believe he's killed her children, (2) making her believe he's going to annul their union and marry someone less controversial, and (3) having her PLAN THE NEW WIFE'S WEDDING. When the wedding guests arrive, and lo! The \"bride\" is actually her long-lost daughter, with long-lost son in tow, everyone enjoys a happily-ever-after moment. (Instead of \"What the heck, Dad? moment.) \n The moral: What seems like psychopathic behavior may, in twenty years, turn out to be a convoluted plan with a happy ending. So uh, have patience. \n The Wife of Bath: After entirely too much information about her five husbands, the Wife of Bath tells the story of a Knight who raped a woman and was brought on trial to the King's court, whereupon the Queen gave him one year to solve the question: What do women want? Having queried high and low to no avail, the Knight resignedly begins returning to the court to meet his death, only to chance upon a horribly disfigured old woman who will give him the answer if he promises to anything she wants. He gives the answer to the Queen and is promptly confronted by the old woman, who bids him marry her. He resists by recounting her faults (poverty, age, etc); she rebuts them by praising poverty, age, etc, and finally he relents to marrying her. She then asks him: would he rather she be old and faithful, or young and tempting to others? He leaves the matter to her, and she -- happy that he has ceded his judgement to hers -- decides to become both young and faithful. (Oh, and the answer to 'what do women want?' is 'to be in charge'.)

{"book_id":"19351","rating":5,"review_text":"Note: my version was the Danny Jackson translation (1997) \n When I threw in with the Classics Club, I knew the Epic of Gilgamesh had to be on there. The oldest known recorded story? How could it be missed? I've had intentions of reading it since encountering an excerpt of its Flood narrative in high school world literature, and have even listened to recitations of the drama. For those who have never encountered it: Gilgamesh is a king whose subjects behold him in fear and trembling. So potent is he that he gets away with nicking people's wives on their wedding night. It's good to be the king, no? The people of Uruk plea to the gods for relief from the king, and in response they send him...a bro. A wild man named Enkidu, who alone is Gilgamesh's match for sheer manliness. He is utterly untamed, in tune with the animals and such, until a priestess seduces him with her feminine wiles (and by this translation, she literally jumps him). Abandoned by his four-legged friends in the forest, Enkidu goes to meet Gilgamesh, whose reputation precedes him. After a good brawl to shake hands with, these two men of power start taking down monsters and cutting down trees. They attract the rage of some of the gods -- especially that of Ishtar, who attempts to seduce Gilgamesh but is forcefully refused by him delivering a list of all the men she's used and destroyed -- and Enkidu dies, deflating Gilgamesh's sails. Having previously been blithe about death, Gilgamesh is now hit with its reality, and goes to seek out the only man who cheated death, Utnapishtim, he who survived the Great Flood. Utnapishtim attempts to dissuade him from the immortality quest, but then clues him in on a secret plant -- one which is promptly stolen by a snake. Gilgamesh resigns himself to making the best of life that he can, and that's' that. (Unless you count the last chapter, which involves Enkidu and a brief visit to the Netherworld.) \n Anyone who has read Genesis will see shared aspects and perhaps dimly remember that Abraham originally hailed from the city of Ur, just down the river from the site of Uruk. Most obvious is the Flood story, of course, but so is the snake costing man the secret of immortal life. I found it interesting when I first heard this story that Enkidu's knowledge of woman immediately ruptured his 'one with nature' status. In Genesis, Adam and Eve aren't said to 'know' each other until they've been severed from their own natural paradise and put to work as farmers, but there's still a tenuous link between sexuality and alienation from the natural world. I faintly remember reading that the agricultural Sumerian religious rites involved sex (see the priestess as a reminder), so perhaps that's the connection: he who would control nature cannot be at home in it, and Enkidu does start learning about farming from the priestess after they leave. Other, more distant similarities can be found between Gilgamesh and other ancient stories: Gilgamesh's refusal of a divine seducer, for instance, brings to mind Circe and Odysseus. \n Not included in this translation are the 20 new lines discovered a couple of years ago in Iraq, which add a bit to the Enkidu and Gilgamesh adventures. Apparently they meet monkeys in the forest, and the wild beast Humbaba is presented a forest-king who is entertained. That might explain why Humbaba appears like a man in so much Sumerian art, though that could be laziness or something else. I'm glad this is the translation of Gilgamesh my library has: it's rendered in verse in approachable English, and features 20 illustrations that invoke woodcuts. \n Related \n The Epic of Gilgamesh audio drama, produced by A Podcast History of Our World","date":"2016-12-06"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"Originally posted here \n I feel like I have to start this review by saying that I am not generally a poetry reader. However, in school I loved reading and studying classic poetry so I really wanted to try and read something with more of modern and contemporary feel. Milk and Honey was just the perfect book for me to read as an introduction back into poetry. It was so profound and so moving that I was actually reduced to tears a couple of times. \n This poetry collection explores themes of femininity, love, loss, abuse, violence, and many more. I guarantee there will be something in this collection that every reader can relate to in some way. Despite the melancholic nature of many of the poems, there is an underlying bittersweet feeling. Despite all the trauma that Rupi Kaur experienced, there is still a lot of joy, hope and healing. I really loved this book, some of \n the poems spoke directly to my soul \n and it was like I could have written this book. It was just an amazing reading experience. \n The book has four chapters: 'the hurting', 'the loving', 'the breaking', and 'the healing'. I found 'the hurting' and 'the healing' the most impactful. Rupi Kaur's poetry is so raw and so simple, many of the poems are only a handful of lines. There are also line drawings to illustrate many of the poems which added a lot of visual impact, and really added to the reading experience. I loved the black and white colour scheme, visually representing a sense of yin and yang or good and bad. \n I highly recommend Milk and Honey to lovers of poetry and newbies alike. I think this collection is especially good for those who (like myself), haven't read much poetry since school. There is something in this book that will resonate with everybody. \n Compare prices of Milk and Honey on Socialbookco. \n Disclaimer \n My copy was sent to me for review by the Socialbookco.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"Read in bookshop. Overall it feels like Kaur expressed genuine emotion in her poems and wrote them to deal with certain pains in her life. But I don't believe that she put much effort into constructing them. The ideas and feelings were there, but the words often didn't fit. Some of them rather looked like they were scrippled on a piece of paper during class. Which created a certain raw vibe, but nevertheless, the expressions didn't seem to be her own and in many cases it just repeated itself. \n I wasn't underwhelmed, due to all the critical reviews, but considering the big hype I would have expected a little more. Kaur does have potential though, I believe. A few of her poems could have been made into something a lot greater, if she had sat down and reconstructed them.

{"book_id":"45974","rating":4,"review_text":"If this entire manuscript were to be dumped into one of those new-fangled word cloud thingies that tells you which words come up the most, undoubtedly \"dream\" would win. For Pessoa, life is a dream. Literally, that is his reality. \n The cloud next to \"dream,\" you ask? \"Tedium.\" He uses it to define his life. A lot. Which means this is 460-plus pages of an artistic loner trying to make tedium entertaining. So, yeah. Be forewarned. At times I was 3-starring this, especially toward the end, because it got to be a drag reading about all this \"life is a dream\" and \"tedium again\" and \"death is better than life, only then I wouldn't be able to bemoan life, which is my bread and butter\" stuff. \n Still, this is a great psychological study, to my mind. If Karl Ove Knausgaard is raking bucks these days with his navel-gazing books (the My Struggle series), then it could be argued that Pessoa was ahead of his time. It's navel-gazing par excellence. \n Only there is a distinct difference. Knausgaard is social. His are people books. Pessoa is anti-social. Thus his books are populated with himself. \n I admit, parts of his persona appealed to mine. Some of his thoughts sounded like me in my bleaker moments. And, through it all, you can see the poor guy's love of life. Only he loved being alone, living alone, not traveling, not desiring or needing. Classic homebody.

Look at nature as a collective thing - not individual things. Going into nature you become one with it and with yourself. Removed from civilization, you can truly absorb all nature has to offer. Not as a man with biased opinion and view, but like a child free from corrupting suggestions. Free-ness from others opinions - on your own. \n We are changing, but not by choice. Go with flow and claim independence (from England). We have grown too far apart from one another. Unity has slowly begun to disappear and therefore, men, too individualistic, are no longer complete. We are so defined by what we do - our occupations. This is bad. Scholar means intellect. Be a student and learn. He is too far separated from the other \"men.\" Life, in nature, as a scholar, is like a circle. No beginning. No end. Order is so complete. Learning is the main focus of scholars and do it through organization and order. We all take things to mean \"know thyself, study nature.\" Influences on scholar are (1) nature, (2) past - through books, etc., (3) self-action. What you know and take in may not be what you get out of the book. Changes will always occur. Adapt to them. Don't just accept what you read. Decipher a meaning out of it for yourself. Souls see the truth. You must reach down deep and touch your soul. It won't and can't always be easy. Working hard helps you discover your answers. The past literature can always hit your soul and explain your life today to you. The general knowledge we learn and dislike to learn helps us to create ideas and such for us. When you let something pass you by without learning it or catching it, you lose some power. \n Everything will take off at one time or another. Don't stop things from growing. Learn from your life experience. Live a little. Become the thinker. Sometimes you can't change things, you must accept them the way that they are. We will never learn absolutely everything, for there are barriers. Let yourself go and be open. Tell people who you truly are and be open to accept them. As a boy we have the old world classical thoughts. As a youth, romantic ones, and as an adult, we are reflective. Explore the \"common.\" Today explains the past and the future. The individual is important. World is nothing. Man is all. Get away from Europe. This is what Emerson has to say in a nutshell. \n I was amazed and inspired by his words. I am looking forward to Thoreau, another man I thought to be not very interesting. Maybe, I will have to start really reading things quickly. \n About Me \n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

{"book_id":"91571","rating":3,"review_text":"Book Review \n 3 out of 5 stars to Measure for Measure, written in 1603 by William Shakespeare. When I think of reasons why people find Shakespeare difficult to read or understand, this is the play that most comes to mind. It's a good play. But you won't get much from it on a single read. And if you're not a fan of classic literature, or easily able to understand language differences from 400 years ago, it will be even harder to digest this one. Part of me believes this isn't all that different from some of the popular ones, but because it's often less read, copied or produced on TV or Film, it's much less understood. The plot is clever: a man gives up his position of power to the next in command and watches from afar to see what happens. He's got personal reasons for abandoning his role, but he also doesn't quite leave it. You're left with a quandary both in plot and in persona, which makes it harder to easily grasp on the first round. I basically understood it but didn't find it all that appealing.

{"book_id":"15645","rating":4,"review_text":"Book Review \n 4 out of 5 stars to Inferno, the first of three books in the \"Divine Comedy\" series, written around 1320 by Dante Alighieri. A few pieces of background information for those who many not know, before I get into a mini-review. Inferno, which means \"Hell\" was one of three books Dante wrote in the 14th century, essentially about the three spaces people occupy after death: Hell (Inferno), Purgatory and Heaven (Paradiso). I've only read Inferno, so I'm not able to discuss much on the other two, but I'd like to some day. They were not written in English, so I have read a translated version. These works are considered comparable in fame and beauty as those of William Shakespeare. OK... that said, my thoughts: \n For as long as people have been alive, Christians, that is, they have worried about what happens after death, turning to God and the Bible. In the 14th century, religion was one of the only things people did with their lives besides work and raise a family. They had a lot of time to spend on it, wondering what might happen. Dante captures the exact sentiments we've all felt throughout our lives, and he displays it through the nine circles or gates of hell. He presents it as a torture for all those who did bad things while they were alive. The story, in its basic form, is Dante himself traveling in a boat through the river that runs through Hell, stopping to see each realm. He's led by the famous poet Virgil. He encounters people or archetypes of people he knew and those he's heard of. Essentially, it's a story of justice and the contradictions in religious beliefs for all of God's followers. Dante pushed people to think about their actions and beliefs. And he created a story based on his own journey to say everything he felt about what he's experienced in life. \n It's full of questions. It's been the basis for so many movies, books and plays in the future. It's so often quoted or referenced, it's literally one of the most famous works around... and to think it was written nearly 700 years ago is amazing. Though it's no where near a comparison, it reminds me a little bit of The Ninth Gate, a movie with Johnny Depp, that I love, about people trying to reach the Devil. And it's a translation of a new Spanish author I'm very fond of: Arturo Perez-Reverte. I've read one of his books and plan to read The Club Dumas soon. \n As for this one, I encourage everyone to find a passage from The Divine Comedy, even if you prefer Paradise or Purgatory, something a tad more positive, just to see the language and the lyrics Dante shares. It's beautiful. I could go on and on, but hopefully this is enough to wet your appetite. \n About Me \n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.

{"book_id":"30119","rating":4,"review_text":"Book Review \n 4+ of 5 stars to Where the Sidewalk Ends, a collection of poetry published in 1974 by Shel Silverstein. What a wonderful book to read with children at any age; that is, both any age for the reader and the children! I first read this book when I was about 10-years-old, and then again in college. From the brilliant characters to the alliteration and rhyme, to the memorable lines and funny situations, it's one of those books where you will find something new each time you read it. \n I cannot imagine being this creative. I can dream up stories about real people and situations and have written several, but to have an imagination where animals and things can talk, have emotions, interact in peculiar ways... to find the words to compare and contrast... to describe and draw precious creations... is true talent. I admire Silverstein's massive fantasy world of freedom. He was so unconstrained in his ability to develop a world with just enough charm and beauty to win us all over. It's a book all about perception, but without taking the didactic and pedantic approach. \n Children see things differently than adults. Adults have limits. Children have experiences. But what happens on the other side... where something is too far to see, or too close to imagine? Who lives in the crack between cement blocks? The world of freedom does... and that's where Silverstein wants us to go, where we are all equal, without preconceived notions... to be able to explore as if we are seeing something for the first time... and connecting with everyone around us. That's how to motivate readers with this book... children learning to see more than what they actually see. \n I could go on and on... but I'll stop.

{"book_id":"42038","rating":3,"review_text":"Book Review \n William Shakespeare wrote hundreds of sonnets over three decades, mostly from the 1580s through 1610. I'm assuming most everyone has read a few of his sonnets, given they are usually required reading in high school. There is something to love in every single one of them. There is something to be confused at in every single of them. No one can deny his talent. Whether you enjoy rhymes or prefer just the beauty of the words, the lines definitely create images in your mind of what he's writing about. Love, pain, anger, frustration, beauty, sadness... it's all there. I enjoy them because it's a momentary breath of something new and different. I'm not much into poetry, though I find at times, it's the best reading of all... when you see a full character and his/her thoughts and actions in as little words as possible. Everyone should read a few, find the grouping that work for you, and just get lost in the words for a few hours. See if it makes you think differently about things. It gets a 3 because as good as they are, they are still short poems that sometimes hit the mark and sometimes do not -- so while there are a few that warrant a 5, there are as many than warrant a 1. \n About Me \n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

{"book_id":"15997","rating":4,"review_text":"Book Review \n 3.5 out of 5 stars for Paradise Lost, the first of a two-book series, written in 1667 by John Milton. I've only read the first book in this series, but would like to read the second piece at some point. These are epic poems telling of the battle between Satan and God for control over the human soul. It's truly an introspective piece, as I believe Milton threw so much of himself, as well as people in general, into this work. It's captured the attention of so many people, and not just readers. It's the foundation of several films and television adaptions. Some argue it loses focus on the religious aspects; others praise it for being very open to different experiences. It's the kind of literature that pushes you to think about voice and characters. About different sides to a story and alternative opinions. How does it feel to agree with Satan? Do you accept being disappointed in something God says because it's something you thought was OK to do? So much in the words, but also the message is even more powerful. It's a lot to digest, but if you haven't read it, look up a few passages to see if the lyrical tone is something you can absorb while reading the words.

{"book_id":"112204","rating":4,"review_text":"Book Review \n I love Emily Dickinson's poetry. I recently went to a museum exhibit dedicated to her and fell in love again with one of her poems, which I'll dissect below: \n Critics of Emily Dickinson's poem number 328, commonly titled \"A Bird Came Down the Walk,\" have several different interpretations of the poem. Most critics believe that the poem is a \"conventional symbolic account of Christian encounter within the world of nature...\" (Budick 218). Although several critics take a religious approach to the poem, I disagree with them. I believe that \"A Bird Came Down the Walk\" is about mankind's innate fear of others who are larger/smaller than they are. I also think that the poem explains man's reaction to this fear. The bird in poem number 328 actually represents all of mankind. When the bird is confronted with its fear, it flies away. A (wo)man is as guilty as the bird when (s)he is running away from his/her fears. When we are scared or frightened, we often run away instead of standing up to face our fears. \n The first stanza of Emily Dickinson's poem shows a bird doing what it normally does all day long: \"A Bird came down the walk / He did not know I saw / He bit an Angleworm in halves / And ate the fellow raw.\" However, there is a deeper meaning in this stanza than the idea of a bird simply eating a raw worm. According to Jonnie G. Guerra, \"the speaker's choice of verbs seems to express a desire to anthropomorphize the bird\" (Guerra 29). By giving the bird human-like qualities, the narrator invites the readers to compare the bird's actions to mankind's actions. The man is actually a human being who is eating his lunch or dinner. Since the bird does not know that the reader sees him eating a worm, the bird is perfectly at peace going about his daily business. Humans are identical to the bird in this sense. We follow our daily routines of eating, drinking, sleeping, shopping, and working; yet, we rarely realize that someone may be watching our every move. All throughout the day, parents watch their children to insure their safety, teachers monitor their students' progress in order to help them do well, and bosses keep a close watch on their employees to see if they are doing the work that they were hired to do. There is always a pair of eyes beating down on us to scrutinize our every action, just like the narrator scrutinizes the bird's actions. Through the bird, who is unaware of the man watching him, the narrator shows that no one is ever completely alone. The bird may be in danger, and it feels as though someone or something is approaching it. \n The second stanza continues with the anthropomorphization of the bird: \"And then he drank a Dew / From a convenient Grass / And then hopped sideways to the Wall / To let a Beetle pass.\" The reader sees the resemblance of the bird to a human in this stanza when the bird drinks a dew because \"grass\" suggests an echo-pun on glass (Guerra 29). However, this stanza also sets up a situation that shows the goodness of humankind. Charles R. Metzger \"playfully suggests a fancifully anthropomorphic sense of genteel deportment in the bird's letting a \"Beetle pass\" (Metzger 22). Here, the narrator shows that the bird is kind enough to step out of the way for the beetle, a creature smaller than the bird, to pass by. Continuing with the theory that the bird is actually a human, readers then see how we humans often try to be accommodating to others. When others aren't as capable of doing something on their own, man will often go out of his/her way to make it more convenient for them. When we are in the way of others' goals, we try to get out of their way if at all possible. With its human-like qualities, the bird follows the \"Golden Rule\" just as man does. Since we are never alone in the world, we must work to make friends. Perhaps, the bird is trying to befriend the beetle. It is unlikely, but still, the bird is friendly by moving out of the beetle's way. However, the bird's friendliness isn't enough to keep the bird calm when the stranger/narrator advances toward it. \n As a result, the third stanza shows a change in the bird's composure: \"He glanced with rapid eyes / That hurried all around / They looked like frightened Beads, I thought / He stirred his Velvet Head.\" When the bird stepped to the side, he realized that the narrator was watching him. He wasn't alone at all. Fear starts to enter into the bird's blood, making him look for the nearest escape route. The bird is unsure of the narrator, and what his/her intentions are. The narrator might be there to cause harm, or the narrator could be there to express kindness as the bird did for the beetle. Folk wisdom has always said that the eyes are the windows to one's soul. When the bird's eyes glance all around, the fear is evident; only in a case of extreme fright would the bird's eyes become beady and glassy (Andersen 119). At this point in the poem, the narrator is physically close to the bird. While the bird is afraid of the man who is close to him, we humans are afraid of the people closest to us. The people who know us best and are closest to us have the power to hurt us the most. We are so unaware of other's eyes beating down us at times that we become victims quite easily. We may be accommodating to a point, but we should never be accommodating to the point that we lose our focus and our direction. We need to hold back from others so that we maintain some order in our lives. Fear cannot take control of us. When it does, we must get away from it somehow, just as the bird does. \n The fourth stanza of the poem shows the bird reacting to the narrator's approach: \"Like one in danger, cautious, / I offered him a Crumb / And he unrolled his feathers / And rowed him softer home.\" Now, the narrator approaches the bird and offers to feed him, but the bird is frightened and flies away. The bird is quite small in comparison to the narrator. The narrator's size is what scares the bird away. Charles R. Anderson notes that Dickinson \"keeps the whole garden world reduced to the bird's size. The [narrator] is left towering above and outside, having no magical elixir like Alice in Wonderland to shrink her down to a level where communication is possible\" (Anderson 118). Jerome Loving agrees by pointing out that \"if there is any suggestion of danger, it comes when the human narrator offers the bird a crumb. The truth is that nature is a nice place, a pastoral scene until man blunders on stage with the full weight of his past and future\" (Loving 56). We humans have the same innate fear as birds when we face someone who is larger than we are. If someone is higher up on the corporate ladder than us, we are constantly afraid that he or she will fire us. Students have the fear of teachers failing them just as the bird feels the human will hurt him. Children feel afraid of their parents punishing them at times also. Everywhere we turn, there is someone who is stronger or more important than we are. We will always feel as though others are going to do something to hurt us; therefore, we need to escape this fear by running away like the bird does. If one looks at it another way, the bird could also be afraid of the entire world. Even though the beetle is smaller than the bird is, the bird might still be afraid. It is common knowledge that elephants are often afraid of mice, which are hundreds of times smaller than elephants are. Perhaps the bird's nerves are on edge, and he is afraid of anything that makes a slight, sudden move. The beetle could cause harm too. Humans are often afraid of spiders and bees, which are quite small in comparison to man. Nevertheless, the bird runs away just as man does when confronted with a situation he fears. \n The fifth stanza shows that the bird flies away softly and quickly: \"Than Oars divide the Ocean / Too silver for a seam / Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon / Leap, plashless as they swim.\" The bird knows that it is in danger and must leave as quickly as possible. Also, the bird wants to leave quietly, in the hopes that the narrator doesn't realize that the bird is leaving. We humans also try to leave swiftly and quietly. We know when we have been defeated, and we try to leave with our tail between our legs. We are ashamed and upset that someone has hurt us or tried to hurt us, so we escape. Running or flying away may not be the best way to handle the situation, but that is all that we know how to do. Man is accustomed to flee a situation rather than to confront it. Therefore, the bird, who represents man, flees too. \n According to Anderson, \"The dangers as well as the beauty represented by nature at large... are here concentrated in a single bird that exhibits a complex mix of qualities: ferocity, fastidiousness, courtesy, fear, and grace\" (Anderson 221). The bird in Emily Dickinson's poem \"A Bird Came Down the Walk\" can be representative of humans, since humans have the qualities such as fear, courtesy, and grace in their personality. Dickinson's poem comments on man's innate fear of others. We humans are always being watched and when we realize how close someone is to us, we need to run for fear that (s)he will hurt us. Our fleeing is done with grace and courtesy. It is a reaction that all humans have at one point or another. Dickinson's poem shows the readers this fear and the results of the fear on mankind. \n About Me \n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.

{"book_id":"2696","rating":4,"review_text":"Book Review \n It was 1996 and my freshmen year at college. I had already declared English as my major and needed to choose between Chaucer and Shakespeare as the primary \"classic\" author to take a course on. I chose Shakespeare. My advisor told me that's the usual pick and most missed out. I laughed at her. She was 40 years older than me and told me all the dirty stuff was in Chaucer... \"Are you sure?\" she asked. At that point, I realized life was just beginning. I was so naive back then. We clicked and bonded over my 4 years at school. I later realized she taught the class and that's why she always joked with her prospective students. I ended up taking both, and I am so glad I did. I adored Shakespeare, but until you've read all of Chaucer's work, you don't realize what a canon it is. From The Wife of Bath to The Squire, the satire, humor and innuendo are at an all-time high. No clue how he wasn't burned at the stake for all that he wrote about in the 14th century. Simply put, pilgrims are on a journey to/from Canterbury and tell their tales. It's woven so well together, you can't help but feel as though you're part of the ride. If I didn't have a backlog of over 1000 books in my TBR, I'd take on this tome again. It's lyrical, humorous and thought-provoking. It's nonsense, weird and crazy. But that's what makes it worth a read. If you have a copy, sample one of the stories.

{"book_id":"12914","rating":3,"review_text":"Book Review \n 3 out of 5 stars to The Aeneid, a classic work written in 17 BC by Virgil. \n In The Aeneid, Virgil creates two vastly different archetypal heroes named Turnus and Aeneas. Aeneas is a Trojan prince who has hopes of finding a new Troy in the land of Latium, but he runs into an angered Turnus, a Rutulian prince that does not welcome Aeneas. Both men are equally strong, equally determined, and have equal and rightful claim to the land. However, Virgil creates this distinct difference and hatred between the men that leads to the profound greatness of Rome. \n Turnus is a Rutulian prince who is planning on marrying Lavinia, the princess of Latium. He is courageous when he defends his people in the war against the Trojans (Book IX and X), brilliant in his plans to attack the Trojan camp (p.207), yet motivated to win for purely personal goals. Turnus sacrifices public welfare and the good of the state just to defeat Aeneas and win the battle and Lavinia. Aeneas is also a prince who is planning on marrying Lavinia. He is caring when he looks back for his late wife Creusa (p.57), respectful and loving when his father dies (p.80), and driven when he continues his journey to find a new Troy (p.103). However, unlike Turnus, Aeneas is truly unselfish in his reasons for wanting Latium. Aeneas wants to settle the land for his people and their families, to find a new Troy. Aeneas does not want the land to be selfish. Both Turnus and Aeneas have determination behind them, physical and mental strength behind them, yet most of all the gods behind them. \n With the help of Juno, Turnus fights till the end avoiding several near deaths such as Pallas' arrow and his jump into the Tiber River fully armored. Similar to Turnus, Aeneas' mother helps Aeneas by giving him protection with the creation of the shield (p.198), and when she heals Aeneas' wound with the special potion (p. 302). Turnus and Aeneas up until this point have no differences. They are identical in their strengths, weaknesses, and support. However, the one major difference between them is that Aeneas has destiny behind him. He is fated to take care of his Trojan people, find a new Troy, marry Lavinia, and bear descendants to establish the great city of Rome. Aeneas has no choice but to win the war and Lavinia's hand in marriage. Turnus must lose and somehow suffer; He cannot escape his fate. Virgil makes use of the difference between the two heroes using antagonism, hatred and most of all the superiority of Aeneas to show the greatness of Rome. \n At the time The Aeneid was written Augustus Caesar was in power and the Pax Romana was beginning. Rome was in a state of absolute reign and greatness. Virgil makes use of the character Aeneas to show the greatness of his friend Octavian or Augustus Caesar. He uses the difference between the two heroes to show that by destiny via Aeneas (an ancestor of Octavian Caesar) Rome will lead the world in philosophy, art, and intelligence, etc. Turnus is good, but Aeneas is better and so is the new emperor Caesar. With Octavian Caesar in control, Rome will become even greater than it is. Virgil accomplishes his goal of glorifying Rome and its leader Augustus Caesar. \n Virgil creates a strong similarity between Turnus and Aeneas, however the major characteristic of these two heroes is that Aeneas is destined to win and Turnus to lose. This difference greatly surpasses the likeness between the two men and leads to the exaltation and glorification of Rome.

{"book_id":"118389","rating":3,"review_text":"Review \n 3 of 5 stars to the poetry of T.S. Eliot, specifically, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock and Other Poems. \n In \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", a man confronts his physical sexuality during an elite social gathering. The man, J. Alfred Prufrock, breathes in his surroundings and then uses them to define his own appearance as the antithesis of what he sees. The man has no self-esteem and therefore constantly dwells on his negative attributes and less-than-perfect features. In the poem, Prufrock recites a long monologue that is characteristic of almost every other human being. T. S. Eliot uses Prufrock as a symbol, for humanity in general, to show how all persons are doubtful at times of their attractiveness. \n Prufrock is a man of uncertain age. (Spender 31) Therefore, he can be portrayed as a teenager, a middle-aged man, or a person of any other age very easily. If one looks at Prufrock through the eyes of a teenager, he can easily be seen as a seventeen-year-old. While Prufrock is \"like a patient etherized upon a table\" (line 3), teenagers roam the halls at school like puppy dogs with their mouths open, dazed and lost in space. Both are in love with some beautiful woman and wander the paths practically drooling. While Prufrock is busy finding time \"for a hundred indecisions, and a hundred visions and revision\" (lines 32-33), teenagers are occupied thinking of ways to approach the person they want. Both seem to put facades on to make themselves sound better so that they will get the person they want to get. While Prufrock is worrying \"with a bald spot in the middle of his hair - (How they will say his hair is growing thin!)\" (lines 41-42), teenagers constantly, in vain, check their own hair in the mirror to see if it is just perfect! There are several similarities between young people like teenagers and Prufrock. However, not only does Prufrock resemble teenagers, but he also resembles middle-aged men who are hitting a mid-life crisis. They worry about their hair balding or becoming gray and whether they are attractive enough. They go out and try to reinvent themselves as different people just as Prufrock does with his revisions, decisions, and visions. Prufrock has characteristics of several different people of all ages. Eliot is showing that all men (women included) have doubts and occasional low self-esteem. Whether you are 17, 37, or 57, you are capable of having no confidence occasionally. This is Eliot's generalization of all men. \n Prufrock's worries concerning his sexuality and appearance not only show his resemblance to all men, but they also stop him from continuing on with his life as a happy, caring, and normal man. \"He is Eliot's archetype of the great refusal, the man who fears to dare and so misses life... ...Prufrock initiates Eliot's obsession with the lost opportunity and the missed life.\" (Mayer 127) Prufrock is so busy concentrating on his less-than-perfect features and supposed negative attributes that he lets life pass him by. \"I grow old... I grow old... I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\" (Line 120-121) Prufrock loses the future by concentrating on the present. His inhibitions about the opposite sex hold him back. \"'Prufrock' is built around the arid, timid, conventional persona of a man sexual enough to admit desire, but insufficiently sexual to do anything about it.\" (Raffel 24) In every person's life they feel like this occasionally. They love someone, but they hold themselves back because of some fear, etc. Eliot uses Prufrock as a symbol for all men again. \n \"Prufrock is inhibited, self-conscious, obsessed with image, self-possessed, and afraid... Fear is in the way - the fear to dare, to live honestly, to tell all, to be the Fool. The mermaids will not sing to Prufrock because he will not sing to anyone. His \"love song\" to himself is a cry of anguish...\" (Mayer 128-129) While Prufrock sings to himself, men everywhere are busy talking outlook to the stars, the sky, and the moon about how much they wish they could get the girl they loved or be more handsome, more intelligent, or more loved. Some of these men will cry out in anguish and they will not tell anyone how they feel because of inhibitions. The mermaids (women) therefore will not sing to him if he will not sing to them! All men are afraid to tell a woman how they feel about them often in reality. They will stutter and beat around the bush. Besides the mermaids, there are several other minor characters who can support this theory. Prufrock talks about Prince Hamlet, Lazarus, the Footman, and an attendant lord. He has characteristics of all these men. He attends to others and never pleases himself like the attendant lord. \"Hamlet embodies Prufrock's aspirations to live - that is, to be or not to be\". (Mayer 117) All men have asked themselves that question; Should I do it or shouldn't I? (Referring to asking someone out) All of these people have traits in common with Prufrock, moreover with every other man. Once again, Prufrock is shown to be a symbol for all men. \n In the middle of the poem, Prufrock talks of other men and the effect of the yellow smoke that curled around the windows. \"...And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows.\" (lines 71-72) Prufrock obviously identifies with the lonely men (despite their shirt-sleeves), and perhaps sees their leaning out of the windows as symbolic of his own desire for contact with the world. (Spurr 7) Since Prufrock identifies with the lonely men, therefore, that is proof that others have felt this way. Prufrock, like all others often in their lives, back away from pursuing love from a paralyzing fear that results in the ultimate loss of the object he desires. \"Prufrock watches his possible moment of greatness flicker because of his anxiety over his looks.\" (Spurr 56) All men seem to follow in his footsteps. \n If one looks at a few words specifically in the poem, like \"let us go then, you and I\" (line 1), one can see why Prufrock really is a symbol for all men in general. \"The \"you\" and \"I\" of the first line present greater difficulties. Critics have commonly interpreted them as referring to two parts of Prufrock, carrying on a conversation with himself.\" (Headings 24) Many times Prufrock seems to be having a conversation with someone else, perhaps another man, or even his object of love. However, the poem is really one long monologue. Prufrock is speaking to himself. Men in reality will often do the same when trying to make a decision. They will ask themselves whether they really love the woman, or want to marry her, or want to kiss her, etc. Talking to oneself is a common practice to make a decision. \n J. Alfred Prufrock is a man who is in love with a certain woman, but he is somehow held back from approaching her. He feels unworthy of her, he feels unattractive, and for some reason he is sexually inhibited. At one time in their life, whether it be as a teenager, a middle-aged man, or an older person, men have felt like Prufrock. They have doubts, fears, and inhibitions. Prufrock is truly a symbol for all of humanity in general. \n About Me \n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

{"book_id":"14706","rating":4,"review_text":"I read Johann Goethe's Faust in English and partially in German during a college course many years ago. It had a huge impact on me as a person and me as a writer. Due to it being somewhat \"out there,\" I held back a full 5 rating; however, I cannot stress how much this book makes you think. Beware, it's a little heavy on the literary side, but it's still worth a read, even if you just read the first portion. That said, 4 out of 5 stars... \n Detailed Review(about 1/3 of a paper I wrote about it a few years ago) \n When I first picked up Goethe's famous masterpiece Faust, I was hesitant about reading it. I read Goethe's work while lying on my bed a few hours before I went to sleep. My room was quiet because everyone else was already asleep. I was able to read and consciously take in the contents of the work. I generally don't like to be told what literature to read; however, after reading through the Prologue in Heaven, I was intrigued by the plot of Faust. As I began reading the first part, I was a bit disturbed by the fact that it was not in prose, but that it was in poetical verse. I have never been a great fan of poetry as a genre of literature. Thus I had mixed feelings when it came to reading Goethe's famous literary work Faust from the beginning. \n I wanted to learn something from the story, as I do from all literature. Authors don't just write for 'no' reason; they wish to accomplish something. I then strove to understand the reasons for the literary work's existence. When I skimmed Faust for the first time, I tried to read it for pleasure, but it was a little too hard. I needed to stop and understand what as going on in each scene. However, I soon realized that I was able to place myself inside the text in several different ways. It was at this point that Faust actually appealed to me; I saw myself in the novel as the character of Faust, fighting against the devilish Mephistopheles. I have always struggled with wanting everything from material things to the admiration of others. As a man of flesh and blood, I naturally want great intelligence, power and love. I have always wanted to be number one - a perfectionist - just like Faust. \n So, while I was reading Faust, I was truly reading a biography of my own life, albeit on a much larger scale. I too have lost some faith in my religion, and I wonder if I will be saved; however, unlike Faust, at the time I read it, I had yet to want someone as much as he wanted Margaret (Gretchen). Maybe if I were under the devil's spells like Faust was, I would have fallen just as hard for the woman. I do have the addictive personality that would lead me in the same direction as Faust. With all of this in mind, I read through the novel as though I were Faust. I took on his persona, argued with Mephistopheles, and wished that I had never been born in the end of the work. It is not easy to live a life completely free from the clutches of evil. When you are hopeless and in despair, you need help. Often, humans are not strong enough to recognize from whom they are getting help. Faust enabled me to foresee what would happen to me if I were subject to the devil's influence. \n Faust is a man worthy of my admiration. All throughout the book, both Faust and the actions he sought fascinated me. Like I said before, I felt as though I was reading or watching a movie of my own life. It was as though a dream had come true where I was able to align myself with the devil. The fears that I have in reality weren't present enough in my dreams to stop myself from associating with some Mephistophelean devil. I was able to see what would happen if I took on the persona of evil incarnate turned into man. Faust enabled me to have an out of body experience where I could see what would happen to me if I became what I have always been curious about becoming: A devil-influenced man. \n Throughout the work of Faust by Goethe, I was able to live experiences vicariously. Faust enabled me to try things that I only dreamed about trying. I really felt as though I were reading a novel about myself. I think that this is why the Faustian theme has persisted throughout time; men (and women) everywhere have struggled within themselves fighting between good and evil to achieve their goals and desires. I am no different. \n About Me \n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

{"book_id":"1381","rating":4,"review_text":"Book Review \n 4 out of 5 stars to The Odyssey, published around 800 BC and written by Homer. I was tasked with reading this epic work as part of an Advanced Placement English course in between my junior and senior years of high school. I loved literature back then as much as I do now, and my reading habits probably grew from everything my teachers encouraged us to read during the summer hiatus and mid-year breaks. We sampled literature from all over the world, and this Greek tome was one of the many we read. We only read certain sections, as it's over 500 pages long, but I finished it on my own over winter break that year. It often depends on the translation version you read, as it might make it better or worse for you. I don't recall which one the teacher selected, but it must have been good as I did my quarterly papers on both this book and Homer's other work, The Iliad. The Odyssey was an amazing tale of a journey through the famed Trojan Wars in ancient Greece. Meeting all the gods and goddesses, understanding the genealogy and family structure, the plots between all their shenanigans and games... for someone with my hobbies and interests, this was perfect. The only part I found a bit dull was when it truly went into war-time battle descriptions, as reading details about fighting is not typically something I enjoy. But the soap opera-like quality of these characters cum deity realities was just absorbing fun. The lyrics and the words fly off the pages. The images and the metaphors are pretty. And if you know enough about Greek history, you almost feel as if you're in the story. \n About Me \n For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.

Y no poh, hay varios poemas que son solo eso: dos miserables lineas que parece que salieron de una cuenta de Twitter de frases de amor o algo asi. Como cuando uno googlea \"citas famosas acerca de...\" y aparecen algunas joyitas para escribir en alguna parte, para hacer parecer que uno lee mucho. La cosa es que aca, ademas de haber mucha frase hecha, hay una seccion de poemas calentones que me cargo. Quizas realmente ella siente el amor asi, de manera cliche y heterosexualizada, pero note varias repeticiones de metaforas simplisimas, metaforas que cualquiera pudo haber escrito descubriendo la sexualidad propia y junto a un otro. Quizas eso es lo que me da mas rabia: la valentia para publicar algo moderadamente bien escrito y la verguenza que le da a una equivocarse y, con eso, restringirse a mostrar algo mejor que eso.","date":"2016-12-16"}
{"book_id":"76889","rating":3,"review_text":"I had always thought Cummings was all about punctuation and syntax gimmicks, but reading this slim volume made me reevaluate his poetry. Sure, there are insufferable poems included here that might just be pure poetic masturbation, but when he's successful--that is, when he manages to use those syntactical and punctuation quirks as stepping stones to transcend ordinary meaning--he reaches a depth that can't be reached otherwise, and the effect is often one of chilling delight, from wonderfully cryptic yet perfectly simple \"for love are in we am in i are in you\" and nonsensical but charmingly musical \"what if a much of a which of a wind...\" to odd but darkly compelling \"it is most mad and moonly / and less it shall unbe\" and breathlessly triumphant \"Love only has ever been,is,and will ever be,So.\" I don't know if I want to read all his opus, but I'm still glad I read this collection and found such a voice in American poetry: idiosyncratic, sometimes profound, always passionate.","date":"2016-11-01"}

I first read this for a class when I was in college. It was interesting then, but it didn't really grab me as much as it did others. I remember that it was mentioned in Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit, when Whoopi Goldberg's character gives it to one of the young women who wants to sing. As I have been going through a bit of a transition lately, it has been in the back of my head that I should read this again. So, I dug my copy out and did so.

This is really more like a 7/10... \n It's obvious Kaur is a talented poet with a strong, engaging, relatable voice, which is why this is such a popular book. The issue I have with the book is all of the \"filler\" poems--the two or three lines on one page that sometimes seem more like a fortune cookie than a piece of poetry. (Example: \"you must enter a relationship / with yourself / before anyone else\") I don't think these stand up as individual poems. \n However, the more substantial poems are just that--more substantial, packed with emotion and craft. The structure of the book guides the reader through the emotional arc of a relationship; it is here that I find a reason to excuse the filler poems as acceptable, because they add to the unity of the work as a whole. In light of the entire book, the shorter poems allow for other aesthetic aspects of the book to be realized, mainly all the white space, which is certainly used intentionally, as well as the sketches that adorn most of the pages.","date":"2016-06-22"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"This review originally appeared on my book review blog: justonemorepaige.wordpress.com. \n I haven't really read much poetry. And by that I mean that this is the first time I have read poems that were not assigned in school. It's never really called out to me as a genre. And here I'll be shallow and honest, I picked this one up because the title sounded cool, the cover is gorgeous, and because I have been seeing it all over bookstagram and bestseller lists. I was curious. \n As a result of my limited poetry experience, I didn't really know how to read this. Usually I power through books, wanting to get to the big reveal, the section where the lovers finally get together, the end, as fast as possible. But that wouldn't work here. I mean, it would have taken me maybe 30 minutes to get through the whole book reading it that way and I wouldn't have gotten anything out of it. So here's what I did: I read slowly. I limited myself to one section a day and tried to really make sure I had \"read,\" think: absorbed, each poem before moving on to the next one. It was a great lesson in slowing things down, if nothing else (which I probably needed, and do appreciate). But it was assuredly so much more than that. \n So, taking into account my super limited experience with poetry, I will say that I straight up loved reading these poems. It's such a beautiful, strong, feminist collection that packs a punch in a totally accessible (an overused word in book reviews in general, I know, but as a poetry newbie, I was really afraid of my perceived inaccessibility of the genre), non-overbearing, comfortably aggressive way. Despite her poem towards the end \"to all you young poets (p. 202) with advice to never trade honesty for relatability, I felt that Kaur's poems were ultimately incredibly relatable, both in terms of vocabulary used and topics covered. She does follow her own advice though, for I never felt that she sacrificed honesty in order to do so. What an incredible gift, to be able to take your deepest feelings and be able to create, with just words, a representation of them that is universally recognizable. Kaur writes of the pain and self-discovery, anger and love, revenge and forgiveness, that all women have felt. She owns the pain of relationships, both during and after, and the struggle of putting oneself back together and redefining who you are afterwards. She writes such short pieces that it's unbelievable how much truth and reality she is able to convey. I have felt all those same feelings, but it would take me pages to say the things that she has done in just a few words, striking in their simultaneous depth and simplicity. In reading them, though I didn't know this beforehand, I can see how she is a spoken word artist. The poems automatically flow with that same cadence, even when I read them in my head. \n Some of my favorite parts are the details, the drawings and signoffs, that are strewn throughout the pages. The basic black lines that she uses mirror the structure and mood of the poems perfectly. Both details add much to the poems they are paired with, clarifying connections and deepening meaning. The use of only lowercase letters and periods as the only punctuation as an homage to her mother tongue (which has only one case and no punctuation other than periods) is a lovely touch. And again, similar to the basic black line drawings, that just adds to the ambiance of the book. \n This collection addresses many struggles of being a women, makes and defends feminist points and arguments, and encourages the reader to find and love who they are first and foremost. It is a light hand on your lower back - comforting, yet strong and supportive. A stunning debut.","date":"2017-03-31"}

{"book_id":"18263725","rating":4,"review_text":"The Crossover is 2015's Newbery Medal winner. Written in free verse, it but in rap or hip-hop style, it grated a bit on my literary expectations at first. After all, Newbery award winner Out of the Dust, is also written in verse, but does not have any character with a name approaching the likes of \"Filthy McNasty.\" Still, the novel for Intermediate and Adolescent audiences grew on me and by the end I was sad, but satisfied at the main character's mental and emotional growth. Josh, \"Filthy,\" is a twin of his brother Jordan and they have always formed an incredible team to face life, especially on the basketball court. Initially coached by their father, a retired pro-basketball player, they both have skills far beyond other players their age. But, Jordan is maturing emotionally a bit ahead of Josh, who finds himself cut out of his brother's life in areas of the \"heart\"--for Jordan has a \"first\" girlfriend.

{"book_id":"22151696","rating":4,"review_text":"It's hard to rate poetry. Do you rate it critically or emotionally? For me, poetry is about how it makes the audience feel, so I am going off that.

Someone described it as \"childlike and complex\", which I thought was a fitting description.

{"book_id":"1371","rating":5,"review_text":"I will read this again. \n What an unforgettable experience this has been! I have laboured over Iliad this last month and a rewarding one it has been. \n This massive poem was written in 750 BC by Homer. Poetic, lyrical, it reads like nothing I have read before. A brutal poem on the inescapable tides of fate and a celebration on the meaningless brutality of war. \n It begins in the middle of the Trojan War and ends far before the end and covers the story arc starting with Agamemnon offending the god Apollo, Agamemnon's judgement being clouded by the goddess folly, resulting in his insulting Achilles and the war between the Trojans and Achaens that follows. \n Most of the book is gory, graphic descriptions of brutal killings in war. Every scene of killing is beautifully described. Homer probably sat with his quill and thought, \" Let me count the ways to kill thee ?\". \n The best parts of the book are the gods involvement in the war. \n My Gods have always been powerful but good, all knowing, and just. The Greek gods are petty, vengeful, mean spirited and biased. They are awesome! They interfere in the war, favour he who curries to them by sacrificing hecatombs, get annoyed, sulk, cry, behave pettily, plot deviously, fight and bash each other up. The Greek gods are ask powerful and immortal but behave otherwise just as mortals do. Song 21 best depicts the gods at their worst and is my personal favourite. \n As poetic as Iliad is, my favourite passage in it was when Priam goes to Achilles to ransom Hector's body. King Priam kisses the dread murderous hand of Achilles that had slain so many of his sons and makes a heart rending plea to him which includes the line, \" Fear, O Achilles, the wrath of heavens; think of your own father, and have compassion upon me, who am the more pitiable, for I have steeled myself as no man has ever yet steeled himself before me, and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew my son \"","date":"2016-01-24"}

{"book_id":"23534","rating":3,"review_text":"I have to begin by saying I don't consider this poetry, sorry. Writing down words on a page in a poetic format does not constitute poetry. The bulk of the \"poems\" have no poetic devices whatsoever, and only a handful have a fleeting impression of poetic technique. Neither has any technique been invented here to make up for this, other than being brutally honest--alas this is just sheer brave writing. \n Instead, I consider this a collection of vignettes that are brilliantly executed, and capture the essence of pain or desire or hopelessness. \n Crass, vulgar and occasionally grotesque pretty much sums up this collection. But there is beauty in this crassness and vulgarity and grotesqueness, have no doubt of that. The frankness and directness are that of someone opening his soul and innermost thoughts to the rest of the world, even at the risk of being labelled 'a deprave person'. And the simplicity of the language makes it all uncomfortably clear and, to some extent, relatable. Clearly Bukowski has a way of aesthetically expressing disturbing images and desires. \n The reason though for 3 stars is that despite the gems that pop up here and there, most of these vignettes are constantly recycled. There is a lack of growth. The observations and preoccupations of the writer are the same, only stated in different ways in the 300 pages.","date":"2016-05-06"}

He owns up to some of his (arguably) indecent fantasies and simultaneously recognizes how those fantasies are widely perceived.

The poems are generic love poems without much substance so it feels like you can relate, however, and maybe it's just me, but I like seeing some vulnerability and intimacy in poetry. If I didn't know any better, I'd say a fourteen year old girl who has fallen in love for the first time wrote this.

I loved her short, meaningful, and her amazingly simplistic yet insightful poetry. I loved the positive messages she delivered to her 600k followers. That with the addition of the praises I kept seeing on Instagram over milk and honey, I had high expectations for her book. \n Sadly, that wasn't the case. I was expecting to love this book, I thought it would speak to my soul, but it was one big letdown. While I thought that her simplistic way of writing was her strength, it turned out to be her downfall. Her writing was too simple, too on the nose, and not poetic enough. Sometimes it felt like it wasn't poetry but just normal sentences cut off at odd places. \n While on her Instagram page she shares a little bit more of her through her photography and captions, this collection of poems are extremely vague. It's so vague that personal aspect of it was lost, even after reading it I don't know what rupi kaur's life story is. Maybe it's just me, but I thought poetry is supposed to be personal in some capacity (especially the way this book is marketed), but milk and honey felt impersonal. In one poem she writes \"you must never trade honesty for relatability,\" but that's exactly what she with these very broad topics. \n I would like to say that the hype of the book was the letdown, but that's not the case. I think I would say the same even without the hype. What I thought I saw on Instagram was far from what I received in milk and honey.

{"book_id":"6656","rating":5,"review_text":"De momento estoy asombrado de lo maravillosa que es la Commedia (lo de divina fue puesto a posteriori). Dante hace un trabajo maravilloso no solamente a nivel descriptivo, sino que tambien en cuanto a la poblacion de cada circulo. Sin embargo, lo mas maravilloso de la Commedia es dejarse llevar por la musicalidad de sus versos endecasilabos y de la estructura de comedia. \n Esta primera lectura la estoy haciendo sin los comentarios, simplemente dejandome llevar por la musica de la poesia de Dante. Pero es de notar, que es necesario haber leido la Eneida (a fin de entender las multiples referencias que Virgilio hace a su propia obra) asi como leer los comentarios de Anna Chiavacci para entender los arcaismos utilizados por Dante asi como el contexto historico y muchos de los habitantes de sus circulos. \n Simplemente maravilloso.","date":"2016-01-13"}
{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"Rupi Kaur is a young poet who was thrown into the spotlight when a university photo project image of her lying in bed with menstrual blood stains on her pajamas and sheets was banned by Instagram. Her protest with the social media outlet expanded her followers by thousands and her already successful book of poetry became a bestseller. Her work is very socially conscious, exploring race, femininity, abuse, love, heartbreak, and identity. \n milk and honey is a self-published book of raw, eloquent poetry and prose. Her work is part memoir, part activism. Each poem broke my heart and left me reaching for the healing that she carves out of her world at the end. Kaur is a spoken word artist, and her writing reflects the rhythms of a stage, but translates well enough to paper that the reader does not feel too strongly that they have missed the sense of the poetry. Those interested in feminist love stories, inner strength narratives, and powerful writing will find what they are looking for in Kaur's poetry.","date":"2017-02-19"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"https://ayearofbooksblog.com/2017/03/... \n Here's to International Women's Day, a day to celebrate \"the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity\" (https://www.internationalwomensday.com) \n You might ask, what am I reading on International Women's Day? As part of a CanadianContent Bingo challenge, I have finished Milk and Honey, a feminist book of poetry and drawings by Rupi Kaur. Those of you that are followers will know that poetry is not my typical genre of choice and if I am honest, my poetry of late has been full of children's poetry ranging from Dr. Suess to Shel Silverstein! \n In the spirit of honouring women, I will share that this is a very personal collection of poems which are divided into sections of: the hurting, the loving, the breaking and the healing. At times, her poem and prose are raw, visual and personal sharing insight into relationships of both pain and love. At times, her writing is uncomfortable and fairly explicit, focusing on abuse and disrespect of women. \n The author is originally from India but moved to Toronto as a girl. It is interesting to note that Milk and Honey was originally self-published before being accepted by a publisher 4 months later and being re-released. \n I think it is fabulous that we have the freedom to write intimate feelings and share what our thoughts through poetry. We have the freedom to read, and the freedom to choose what we read. Although this is not necessarily a book that I would read again , I applaud this young author for her honesty, creativity and for the intimacy of her writing! \n As a side note, the other book that I am reading which is relevant to International Women's Day is The Right to Be Cold, which is a memoir of a strong woman from the Arctic striving to protect and nurture her community. This is one of the 5 books being defended for Canada Reads.","date":"2017-03-08"}
{"book_id":"2696","rating":3,"review_text":"The Canterbury Tales was weird. This book was full of fart jokes, sex scandals, old moral tales, and preaching. It's unfinished in a couple of ways: there are supposed to be four tales per person but there is only one from only a few people, and some of the tales aren't even finished. The book is also really old. That means the stories are usually from Greek/Roman antiquity or Biblical. There are a couple of tales that are so long winded that some editors just took them out and put in a summary, like they are literally just taking up space. I read through all of it and it did transport me to another time and place, and I got to see the morals of the time from different eyes, and some of them were funny (but usually lewdly funny). But seriously, this is just a book to read to check it off and say you've read it just because it's THE Canterbury Tales! If I would have known what it was going to be like, I would have skipped it. I can see some people being fans or even superfans because it is amazing historically and literarily. But for me, it was just okay...and also long and weird.","date":"2016-04-05"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"I used to be one of those people who didn't like or understand poetry. Before my college poetry seminar, my exposure to poetry had been limited to what, I guess, you could call the Western canon for poetry (aka a complete bore to me). Thankfully, by the time I came out of that class I had acquired an appreciation for poetry - both reading it and writing it. I'm still not interested in classic poetry - I don't care for rigid rules nor do I care for the stories most classic poetry tells. But I have an appreciation and love for poetry that breaks rules, isn't rigid, and doesn't fit the Western canon. Hence why I enjoyed this. Well that and it's feminist as fuck. \n One of the major critiques I've seen of this collection is that it's too simple. I curse myself a little bit for reading other reviews but on this point, I have to vehemently disagree with the mindset that it's \"too simple.\" Do I think it's doing anything new or offering a perspective that hasn't been heard before? No. But the idea that something has to be complex or complicated to be profound, insightful, meaningful, impactful, etc etc. is ridiculous. But I digress. \n Anyway, I enjoyed this collection for what it was. I read it quickly and all at once and given my mood that night, it was exactly what I need. I'm sure I'll revisit this collection again in the future but for now, I'm glad to have read it.","date":"2016-09-14"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":2,"review_text":"| 2.5 stars | \n I don't hate the poetry in this book - if anything, I admire most of the messages that were conveyed in Milk and Honey- I just find the writing to be underwhelming. The aesthetic and structure of Milk and Honey reads seamlessly from start to finish, and it's clear that a lot of people are going to enjoy Rupi Kaur's journey to self-acceptance and understanding. But apart from how well-structured the book is, I can't help but feel like most of her writing is very much like a Hallmark card, except done in a minimalist-fortune-cookie-hipster fusion. \n (All of the images above are from Rupi Kaur's blog on tumblr) \n Call me heartless and critical (and then I'll sit there and start whimpering because I'm actually that fragile), but none of this seems special. Most of it sounds like a reiteration of every key word you see in Tumblr poems, and when I read poetry, I expect it to be more than just pretty-sounding. I expected Milk and Honey's content and themes to have more nuance to them. \n But hey: it's a really pretty book. \n [Ok, little sidenote of another reason why I couldn't bump this up to three stars: I really didn't agree with how Kaur dealt with the idea of self-love. Although some of her poems were empowering, I didn't appreciate the whole \"if you can't love yourself, no one else can love you properly\" spiel (this is paraphrased- I'm too lazy to find the exact quote). I call bullshit, okay? I get that you should always recognize that you deserve to be treated with respect and care, and I get what Kaur was trying to say: recognizing this means leaving behind certain loved ones. But the whole \"teach others how to love by loving yourself\" thing falls short because it disregards the struggle of those with depression, anxiety, addiction, or self-esteem issues (umm aka me the sucky human being). Sometimes, people like me can't love ourselves. Sometimes we feel like shit all the time. Sometimes, we love as hard as we can and we are fucking glad to have people to support us- and sometimes, we feel like shit all over again because everybody seems to like how poetic \"how can people love you when you can't love yourself\" sounds (this quote here is not from Rupi Kaur but from pop culture in general ugh).

Most of the scenes are shot on green screen where the actors seem like they're not in the same location (similar to a LibriVox, multi-reader production). It was really tough to watch for although it was well intended, it was very hard to follow and sustain interest. \n I like this plot of this play and understand why it's called a 'problem' play. I like it's complexity and, like all of Shakespeare's plays, I appreciate how his work reveals the truth of humanity: The good, the bad, and the ugly. \n The story presents various themes regarding justice, mercy, law, as well as the role of women.

I am still working on making tough decisions in my current role as the director of our office. Sex, of course, is also one of the central themes of the play and features elements of prostitution, causal sex, or blackmail sex. \n Regarding justice, \"The play Measure for Measure seems to suggest that people should be answerable to their sins but should receive the same treatment that they have given out.

{"book_id":"18263725","rating":5,"review_text":"The Crossover by Kwame Alexander \n The Crossover is an incredible piece of writing that will lure readers in with the overriding theme of basketball but delivers so much more about the meaning of life. Normally, a teen novel written in prose flows well but in this case, the language paints such vivid images and thought provoking ideas, that the reader slows down to enjoy not only the story but the language as well. This book also offers a different perspective of the basketball dream. Normally it is someone from a bad neighborhood attempting to escape their plight, but in this case, there is a well-developed family dynamic that many teens will find themselves relating to one of the characters, or situations presented. \n A few of my favorite lines: \n Basketball Rule #3 \n \"Never let anyone \n lower your goals. \n Other's expectations \n of you are determined \n by their limitations \n of life. \n The sky is your limit, sons. \n Always shoot \n for the sun \n and you will shine.\" (66). \n \" . . . talking to your brother \n Right now \n Would be like pushing water uphill \n With a rake son.\"(91)","date":"2016-01-01"}

Even though it was an incredibly quick read, having finished it in 20 minutes, I found that it just didn't live up to the overwhelming hype. \n Coming from someone who LOOOOVES poetry and poetic works of art, I found this to not really fit into the same box as you would expect. A LOT of the poems were just words spaced out between each other. Some were just sentences that were strung together with no rhyme or rhythm. I just didn't FEEL the lyrical momento that you would typically expect. \n I found that the first three sections were quite contradictory to the message she was trying to relay. She discusses Rape and the psychological effects of it, but later goes in to discuss sex in a harmful way. When it gets to the 'loving' and 'breaking' sections there are so many conflicting messages. I don't NEED a man, I WANT a man (which is so empowering), yettttt my man and I fight and we don't love eachother like we used to, but I am going to let him **** me anyway. \n The HEALING section is why I gave this 2 stars instead of 1... In the first three sections I think I marked 2 poems which resonated with me. In the 'Healing' section I resonated with quite a fair bit of them. The poems discuss how you WILL heal and overcome the issues you face. It discusses loving yourself before anyone else and is actually quite powerful.

I always watched the series and moves from Winnie the Pooh as a little girl so I wonder how they got the idea for the series while the book is not specific about a bear, a kangaroo, a tiger, a piglet and so on. I should do some background research, as soon as I stop yawning (aka after sleep). \n I like the little poems a lot.

It's absolutely astounding to see how he manipulated words with visual intention in mind-- and he was truly a genius for breaking the rules. His later works were my favorite though, as it were the ones that were truly in touch with his thoughts, and it's something I found myself relating to. \n E.E.

But I did appreciate the wit of Pushkin/his narrator in this book. Pushkin had the interesting technique of giving his narrator a very strong voice in this piece, and it was a bit off putting at first when it was unexpected, but as I got used to it, I enjoyed the charm of the vocal narrator. \n As to the story, I will just say that the last chapter made the whole narrative pay off.

The idea of \"poetry\" has baggage. It wants us to see or expect something particular and I don't think Kaur would appreciate the label. I've seen some review it as a journal, as a collection of thoughts. I think I respond best by leaving it as emotions. Kaur is honest and brave, her writing exposes herself at its strongest and weakest, its most loving and most petty. Too much of the writing feels incomplete - half thoughts, a phrase here and there that was written down and never returned to, or an image that longed to be part of a larger work but never got there. There are retorts that feel lost, comments that think they are more interesting or unique then they really are. There is good and there is not very good. I think she is best in the longer pieces early on that address sexual abuse and women's bodies. But I come to this idea of emotions, because in the end my feeling is that this wasn't about writing something for an audience as much as it is about her having written for herself and now has steeped up bravely and invited us to look.

And I get why collections like Milk and Honey are leading the way since they're so accessible. \n But y'all... this collection just isn't that great. \n I would be okay with the shift in tone if it was just from section to section, but it happens within sections too. Especially in the first section, \"the hurting,\" I felt like I was experiencing mental whiplash. Does she hate her father? Does she resent him? Does she pity him? I couldn't tell you! \n There were other inconsistencies too. I've seen Milk and Honey lauded as a feminist text, but there are poems where Kaur writes about the same \"not like other girls\" attitude that she decries in the final section. I suppose you could see it as growth that she gets over it by the end of the book, but those poems don't really fit in with the rest of the \"the breaking\" section (which was actually the section I enjoyed the most, the aforementioned poems excluded), and it would have made more sense to leave them out. All the rest of the poems in Milk and Honey deal with either Kaur's relationship to herself or her relationship with a relative or lover, and the addition of a poorly sketched third person adds nothing to the collection as a whole. \n The section \"the loving\" had some of the worst poems, in my opinion. I think Kaur is at her best when channeling her rage and feminine strength, and her \"the loving\" poems just seem sentimental and trite by comparison. \n The last section, \"the healing,\" was very feel-good, but shallow and reminiscent of new age texts. \n There wasn't anything offensive or overtly terrible about Milk and Honey, it just didn't leave much of an impression. I don't want to rain on the parade of the many, many people who have enjoyed it (particularly young women), but I do hope they can graduate to something with a little cmore substance, say, Sylvia Plath or even Ada Limon for a more contemporary example.","date":"2016-06-03"}

I've also read his newer collection, and I had a lot of the same problems with it as with this one. I guess I just prefer poetry where I can actually tell what the poet is writing about.

My favorite section was \"Questions\" in the \"Fourth Quarter\" Chapter. I loved this section because real questions were asked that so many times are never spoken between a father (or mother) and a child.

{"book_id":"15645","rating":4,"review_text":"Inferno is part one of the Divine Comedy Series where Dante Alighieri puts across his version of Hell, Purgatory and Heaven of course based on the Christian perception along with the addition of Greek Mythology. \n Dante is lead on by his dear friend Virgilius through the Inferno and Purgatory, further Beatrice comes forward to lead him through the Paradise . \n Dante has divided the hell in 9 circles with further subdivisions and all the sinners namely Heretics, Gluttonous, violent ones, Flatterers and Adulterers, Avaricious ( The Seven deadly sins )are punished based on the extent of their acts . All of this is in the form of 34 cantos each giving a visual description of what Dante and Virgilius see. \n My take on Dante Alighieri \n Books like this make me question and ponder about the author and what he went through in his mind while writing as I try to put myself in their shoes. \n I feel that Dante isn't really a very nice person . \n He is Narrow minded and completely Orthodox person who seems a bit of a sociopath to me . \n He is that cranky old neighbor who yells at you saying that you are going to hell. \n He is the Taylor swift of 13th century because if he doesn't like you then he will probably send you to hell in his book and let you get Sodomized by huge serpents (Hentai much ? Yes ) . \n He is in love with Beatrice and she is pretty much his Muse in all of his writings . \n What I like about the book \n * The Imagery is impressive! \n Dante ensures that all his sadistic punishments are explained beautifully such that you get a really clear picture in your head while reading it and the translator has done a great job with that . \n * This book gave me Food for thought which is surprising because I consider myself an Agnostic but I couldn't stop being scared about the things he mentioned .It makes me think about what is supposedly right and wrong . \n * I love how this books has used allegories from Greek Mythology and I am obsessed with Greek mythology so this book gets a brownie point from me because of that . \n * The flow of the poetry is eerie and dark ! Think of Poe, Susan Taylor Coolidge and Sylvia plath sort of gritty and dark and multiply them all . I happen to like Dark concepts, in fact that is the very reason that i picked up this book on the first place. \n * Dante keeps ranting about the people he doesn't like and how he believes they will be tortured in hell is sort of amusing in a dark sort of way .He has a sick sense of humor. \n What I didn't like about this book \n * This book can be a bit offensive Very offensive to a lot of people because according to this anybody who isn't baptized a Christian has a ticket to hell booked for them . \n I think that is a very narrow mentality but then it shows this book is from Renaissance Italy time so everything seemed like an uprising I assume. \n He writes pretty vile things like \n \"Between his legs were hanging down his entrails ; \n His heart was visible and the dismal sacks \n That maketh excrement of what is eaten. \n How mutilated, see, is Mahomet \n In front of me doth Ali weeping go \" \n * Dante has a very pessimistic attitude which reflects upon the book and make you question the so called \" Divine Judgment \" . \n The WORST sinner as per Dante is JUDAS for having deceived Jesus ! \n Conclusion \n This book got me really thinking about this conclusion part and I realized that this book is Fantastic in the literary point of view as it is rich in imagery and flow of the verses , the language and the structure of the cantos is simply perfect . \n Do I believe it ? Well I don't know really it just seemed really overwhelming and Dante really is a prude but I guess I am a little carried away right now maybe but that doesn't mean I am going to be in this state of mind for a long time because there is only so much of religious crap I take in . \n Would I recommend this to anyone ? Yes ! Like I said earlier the book is fantastic if you read it with a broad spectrum and it's pretty insightful too, and I honestly believe that books like this are meant to be read like that . \n Basically Dante is just using fancy words to say that - \n Y'all going to hell beaches ! \n Except Beatrice . \n Cuz she my Bae .","date":"2016-05-21"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"** spoiler alert ** \n First of all before I say anything, let me just note here that I am not really much of a poetry person so this book beside me, it is pretty foreign but I wasn't disappointed by it. It is an eye opener, it is an epiphany and in an astounding way, it teaches some of the most valuable lessons about life as a women, how to recognise one's self-worth as well as the importance of remedying the heart and soul after experiencing severe emotional distress. \n Having said that, I actually had many mixed feelings for about three quarters of the book. There were some parts that I absolutely loved, some that I either didn't like or I didn't feel connected to quite so much and then there were some that made me feel pretty uneasy at times. To make this book easier for me to rate, I will break down my review into 4 parts, one for each of the chapters and at the end I will give my overall rating as an average of the 4 individual chapter ratings. \n So \"the hurting\" chapter was the chapter I liked the least, so I give it a rating of 3 out of 5. I have to say that given the situation of the girl who was undergoing severe trauma, the poems in this section of the book often made me feel uncomfortable at times and even out of place as the descriptions were VERY explicit in terms of the emotional abuse and rape. Don't get me wrong, I've read content like this before but while reading this, I would often feel very disturbed and I would get confused while figuring out if it was the father or the uncle who was abusing her. Keep in mind, this is coming from a person who hasn't read poetry in a long time (and the poetry I read in high school sucked) so I while I was reading, I had to go back and forth to understand some parts more properly. However, the redeeming factor of this chapter would have to be the memorable quotes that I picked up on and Kaur's colourful writing style. \n Some of my favourite quotes throughout this chapter include: \n \"she was a rose \n in the hands of those \n who had no intention \n of keeping her\" \n \"there is no bigger illusion in the world \n than the idea that a woman will \n bring dishonor into a home \n if she tries to keep her heart \n and her body safe\" \n Now onto \"the loving\" chapter - I didn't feel quite impacted by this section of the book since I dont feel as though I can relate as much to the situations of this individual. Much like the previous chapter, the redeeming quality was Kaur's wide web of thoughts and how she coloured in these pages with her bewildering way with words. However, I CAN say one thing about this chapter - it often made me contemplate about how intense it feels when you love someone and how this \"love\" has the power to bring out so many emotions in a person. I felt as though in this chapter, Kaur really pours out her soul onto the pages and she really touches upon how a person can become so emotionally invested in another person that they often forget about themselves and basically, the dangers of \"falling too deep too quickly\". Overall, I give this chapter a rating of 3.5 out of 5. \n Some of my favourite quotes from this chapter include: \n \"you might have been my first love \n but you were the love that made \n all the other loves \n irrelevant\" \n \"the breaking\" chapter, just like the previous chapter \"the loving\" didn't particular hold so much of an impact on me until about halfway towards the end of the chapter. Throughout this section, the protagonist was in a constant state of conflict between her mind and her heart. Because of this, I don't have much to say apart from the fact that I was amazed at how this person eventually got to understand and appreciate her own self-worth after experiencing so much heartache. It soon helped me feel more comfortable with this character and I felt that I, as the reader was more steadfast with the values that were presented later in this chapter. I appreciated how Kaur's writing was very engaging in the way that she delved on how it is okay to feel broken but at the same time it is also very much possible to counteract that and actually HEAL (which is discovered more deeply into the next chapter). For this section, my rating is 4 out of 5. \n Some of my favourite parts of this section are: \n \"this is where you must \n understand the difference \n between want and need \n you may want that boy \n but you certainly \n don't need him\" \n \"when you are broken \n and he has left you \n do not question \n whether you were \n enough \n the problem was \n you were so enough \n he was not able to carry it\" \n \"love is not cruel \n we are cruel \n love is not a game \n we made a game \n out of love\" \n Now finally the last chapter of this book, \"the healing\" was my favourite. Most of the values that were presented in this particular chapter through Kaur's collection of poems were values that felt true to me. In my own life, I like to appreciate the little things that have been offered to me but most importantly, I think that it is EXCEPTIONALLY fundamental for a person to LOVE and appreciate themselves first before they go on to love other people. I'm not saying that they should become so consumed with themselves that they become totally oblivious to the world around them, I'm talking about the fact that they shouldn't become enslaved to the expectations of a multifaceted society, so much so that happiness, freedom and exploring one's true passions dissolve into the realm of imaginations. In this chapter, I also appreciate how Kaur depicts solitude as a window to truly let go of all the toxic habits and help a person to unapologetically live life on their own terms as well as to undo the blunders of the past. These powerful values strongly resonate within me so this is why I found that I could connect so well with this chapter and for this very reason, I give it a rating of 5 out of 5. \n Some quotes that I absolutely LOVED from this chapter are: \n \"you must enter a relationship \n with yourself \n before anyone else\" \n \"it is a part of the \n human experience to feel pain \n do not be afraid \n open yourself to it \n - evolving\" \n \"our backs \n tell stories \n no books have \n the spine to \n carry \n - women of colour\" \n \"your body \n is a museum \n of natural disaster \n can you grasp how \n stunning that is\" \n \"losing you \n was the becoming \n of myself\" \n \"you \n are your own \n soul mate\" \n \"for you to see beauty here \n does not mean \n there is beauty in me \n it means there is beauty rooted \n so deep within you \n you can't help but \n see it everywhere\" \n Overall, my rating for this book in its entirety is 3.8 out of 5 (which would round off to 4). If I were to recommend this book to a particular group of people, then it would be to the people who are trying to move on from a long term or heavily emotionally invested relationship (this book is for you!). Other than that, if I were to recommend a specific section of this book to anyone else, it would be the last chapter (\"the healing\"), but even though I enjoyed this part the most, the preceding parts allowed for a swift build up to this particular section and the values embodied within it! \n And if you are reading this and you (ever so patiently) reached to the end of this drastically long review, then I applauded you for it! \n Till next time, \n Shaira \n Instagram ~ Tumblr","date":"2016-11-21"}

{"book_id":"82356","rating":4,"review_text":"I know that no matter what I write here, it will never be worthy of the Bard. Well, nor my friend Kristen, whom I am certain could do this work much better justice than I am about to. \n A Comedy of Errors is one of my favorite plays. I frequently get slack for this. \"Oh, pft. This is one of his EARLIEST plays. They get so much better.\" \"But, this is just slapstick!\" \"How can you even figure out what they are talking about? The Bard rambles often and refers to now little-referenced bits of history.\" \n Blah, blah, blah. \n A Comedy of Errors is one of my favorite plays because it's so ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. Two sets of twins, separated at birth, have suddenly ended up in the same city. Their father is looking for them, but he is captured and sent to jail. The townsfolk don't realize there are two sets of twins, and everyone keeps getting confused with everyone else. Mistaken identity perfection. \n The problem with just reading A Comedy of Errors is that you miss a ton of the antics. The subtly for all dramatic works is often lost when read instead of performed. I have now read this play many times and see it performed live twice. Each time I find something new. But, unlike many of Shakespeare's other works, you can read this play and still follow everything. The motions and movements of the actors rarely define the text more than the words do-- which is one reason this play is often poopooed at. And that's why I love it. Jokes about people's physical appearance transcend the generations. Subtle insults might not. \n A quick and witty play, I'm glad it has retained its place in Shakespeare's library amongst the dramatic critics. While it might not be the most brilliant of his works, it's still a favorite. After all, you can't bat 1000, right?","date":"2016-08-01"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"Something I wouldn't normally read, but this is brilliant. The poetry is so powerful. Every word, every image is so well chosen and it perfectly defines the emotions of loss, loneliness, regret, love, and learning to love yourself before anything. I decided to read it in small chunks, but I couldn't put it down. I love poetry and this here is beautiful because it speaks the truth about being human and how flawed we really are. It sheds a light on the nuances of relationships and the idea of love which not only exists as the most powerful force between two people, but also a phenomenon that defines who we are as individuals. Learning to love yourself. Learning to see your imperfections and wearing the insecurities and emotional traumas of your past as a badge on your chest is the definition of happiness. Rupi Kaur evocatively presents the truth in these beautiful pages. I'm glad I read it in one sitting rather than in bits and pieces.

What can we learn about the way we communicated with one another and built identity? \n One thing I have had on my mind in evaluating ancient text, is to think critically about where the power is at the time of writing. Whether or not this was written by the poet we attribute as Homer, what is this story saying about power? Who has it? Who doesn't? Why? With the Aecheans and Greece? With the gods?

So much of it resonated deeply with me - particularly the pieces focused on womanhood, sisterhood and beauty. I also connected deeply with the poems on love and intimacy. The pieces about abuse did not resonate with me personally like some of the others, but they were an important addition to the book, and I am grateful that Rupi Kaur trusts her readers enough to let us into that time of her life filled with so much rawness and pain. \n This was beautifully done, and I will absolutely read more from Rupi Kaur.","date":"2016-08-24"}

The use of dazzling imagery, vivid emotional resonance, historical and biblical allusions, and a breathtaking sense of movement, explores several different subjects, including - poetic creativity; sexuality; animism; suicide and death; self-realization and self-transformation; and mysticism. \n If one is so inclined, one can even connect this interpretation to the feminist and creative interpretations to suggest that Plath's ultimate goal was to relate ecstatic frenzy - how we identify and understand the frenzy ultimately reveals our own personality and interest. \n Sylvia PsychoPlath--Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic by the college girl mentality.","date":"2017-06-04"}

{"book_id":"203220","rating":5,"review_text":"Les Fleurs du Mal or The Flowers of Evil or, let's extrapolate here, The Beauty of Evil is a masterpiece of French literature which should have pride of place in any bookcase worth its name, right between Milton's Paradise Lost and Dante's Divine Comedy. For indeed the beauty of evil, what with its mephitic yet oh so alluring aroma, is exactly what this book is about--a collection of poems and elegies reflecting Baudelaire's views on our poor human condition stemming mainly from our doomed lives upon which hovers like the sword of Damocles the inevitability of death, while all the while we keep on fooling ourselves by pursuing the ever so elusive quest for a perfect world, a perfect existence, and, dare we say it, immortality. Baudelaire's answer to this plight of ours, tentative though it may be, is escapism--pure but mainly impure escapism--which, under his pen, takes various forms, ranging from travels to drugs, sex to faith, sleep to contemplation--like so many petals of the flowers of evil the author plucks off one after another in a fateful game of Loves me, Loves me not. \n Needless to say that Les Fleurs du Mal isn't a book for everyone, and that if you're looking for a read to put a smile on your face, you'd do well to turn around and look somewhere else. It is fair to say that with his masterful poetry Baudelaire pierces not only our heart but our soul. His words undress us completely and let us see us for what we really are--just human beings living our lives. Which, when we think about it, isn't so bad. That is, as long as we keep remembering to put into practice this little quote from yet another master of his genre, \"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\" And indeed, it matters not how long we live, but how well we live. If anything, Les Fleurs du Mal taught me that much. Oh, and The Lord of the Rings, too, of course! \n OLIVIER DELAYE \n Author of the SEBASTEN OF ATLANTIS series","date":"2016-09-14"}

I chose it for my Masterworks in Russian Literature class because I'd heard it was the best of the available translations; having only read excerpts of others I can't judge completely, but this translation is certainly masterful on every level. Falen preserves the meter and rhyme scheme, and produces verse that retains much of the light, playful, conversational tone of the original. My native speakers of English in the class said it felt like reading something written originally in English, and my native speakers of Russian said it felt almost like reading it in Russian. It is not of course a word-for-word translation--I guess for that you need Nabokov--but most of the time it is close enough. I admit I was a little taken aback to see that Eugene's \"Moio!\" in Chapter 5 was translated as \"She's mine!\", and I wish they had marked the missing stanzas with lines of dots as is done in the Russian editions I own, but that is such a minor quibble I feel embarrassed even bringing it up, and other than that the fidelity of the translation is almost as impressive as its poetic sense.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"Rating overview \n Writing: \n Content: \n Overall: (4) \n ~~~ \n I have recently heard this being referred to as 'modern poetry' and I guess that's what it is; at first glance, it looks like sentences were merely broken up by hitting Enter. However, it is complex and impactful ideas in short spaces which I guess makes it poetry? The bottom line is that I thoroughly enjoyed this collection (which I guess is the ultimate goal), it made me stop and think which is what I love most about poetry/poetic writing. What I'm trying to say is that this definitely has its place in modern poetry but also modern feminist literature. \n In other words, well worth a read!","date":"2016-02-08"}

I'm high school I probably would have too. But I'm too old for this shit now. I do believe that Kaur has had a difficult life and I'm glad she seems too be in a better place now but I don't consider her works to be poetry. They're mostly generic platitudes that I've seen over and over again and usually done better than I've seen here. Very little imagery, very little descriptions, mostly bold statements where she presses the enter key every so often to break it up. I'm not sure what I expected, definitely something along these lines but with all the good reviews I was hoping for more. Your high school daughter will love it, it'll be new and shocking for her. \n Next time I want feminist poetry I'm going to give Margaret Atwood's poetry a try.","date":"2017-10-03"}

{"book_id":"19164","rating":5,"review_text":"This book is the second part in The Divine Comedy series. This part was much easier to understand and follow than the first part, Inferno. The poem follows Dante's journey to purgatory and entrance into heaven. \n The highlight of the poem is that Dante finally meets Beatrice. The prose is so dramatic that it paints a very vivid image in your mind allowing you to picture and witness Dante as he passes each gate with his guide vigil. Each gate he passes has a story within it providing a synopsis of how they ended up in that particular sphere. Unlike the horrors the first book presented this one is full of angels and descriptive deities as well as individual souls who are repenting for their sins. The only way for them to gain salvation is to ask Dante to request their friends and family to pray for them. \n A nice read.","date":"2016-02-17"}
{"book_id":"15645","rating":4,"review_text":"This was a book I started to read several times only to abandon it midway. But this time I was determined to complete it and understand it fully. It was a little difficult making sense of the language of the poem and understanding what the characters represented. A lot of times I had to re-read the chapters so I could grasp what was written. \n The poem is very insightful and remarkable. Though mostly referring to Christianity I could relate some of the teachings to my own religion and appreciate its relevance. \n It basically describes Dante's spiritual awakening from a period of gloom. He is accompanied by his mentor, the poet Virgil who is sent by Beatrice to assist Dante. The poets go through the circles of hell and come across sinners who are bound to hell for the atrocities they committed on earth. \n One thing that really had me drawn into the poem was the way Dante described the characters and the scenarios enfolding as one progresses in the poem. The images he portrayed with his words were so vivid that one can visualize and feel the torment the sinners were experiencing. \n A very inspiring read. This is one of the books every person has to read in their lifetime.","date":"2016-02-16"}

It's genuinely beautiful to watch him, under his teacher's influence, learn to enjoy and eventually express through poems. A story is told through the presented text and what is implied, or deduced, even. \n I saw the cover and thought it was about a dog. I flipped through and thought it was a book of poetry.

But Kaur has turned on her audience who may use this as a stepping stone into other poets, so there's that. Perhaps they will go onto get Staying Alive: Real Poems for Unreal Times, or at least Poisoned Apples: Poems for You, My Pretty.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"Milk and Honey is a short selection of poetry that is separated into four chapters: hurting, loving, breaking, and healing. Each chapter deals with a different emotion and a different kind of heartbreak. With this structure, Kaur tells a story that is both specific and fragmented. It's obvious that she drew from her own emotions when writing, but each poem can also be an individual experience for the reader. The use of illustrations also helps Kaur's audience to visualize the emotional turmoil that the poems are describing, and at the same time gives the reader something aesthetically pleasing to look at. Some of the criticisms of Milk and Honey revolve around the idea that anything can be poetry if its form follows a traditionally poetic format. While I understand where this criticism is coming from, I disagree. I think that there's more to poetry than just how the words appear on the page. It's what the words do to you that's important. \n You can see the rest of what I have to say about Milk and Honey, and other books like it, on my blog, The Crowded Bookshelf, in the link below! \n http://thecrowdedbookshelf.com/","date":"2017-05-04"}

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":5,"review_text":"There is a distinct lack of poetry in the world. Part of that could be that we hold poetry on this weird dusty pedestal, surrounded by academics all nodding sagely and talking in hushed tones about the power of words. That or we've put it down among the toys for small children, rhyming schemes and sounds that are meant to entertain but often grate on the ears after one too many repetitions. Maybe it's both--maybe we've pushed it to the edges of our consciousness and have decided to be done with it. \n Thank goodness Jacqueline Woodson came along to write brown girl dreaming. This is a book about her growing up as a young black girl in New York and South Carolina. The story talks about how she feels torn between the two places. How life is incredibly different in so many ways, but both places feel like home. This is a story about family, and friends, and feelings. It's a wonderful poem that takes us from the beginning when she's born to when she's told that she's going to be a writer. It's not a long period of time--Jacqueline is still a child when a teacher first tells her that--but it's the perfect length for this book. \n Really the only way to tell this story is the long poem form that Jacqueline Woodson uses. The language flows and you find yourself floating along with Jacqueline, and you get the emotions of the story. She mixes it up beautifully too, with longer narrative poems that make you forget that you're reading poetry, and shorter harder hitting poems, in particular the \"how to listen\" series. There is plenty to talk about as Jacqueline deals with her feelings on religion, death, life, art, people, and growing up as a young black girl in the middle of the civil rights movement. \n ...... \n This book is great for any tween--the younger ones you'll probably want to read it to them, and if your older tween balks at being read to, then you can take comfort that you've giving them a wonderful book to read. \n Read the rest of the review at reads4tweens.com","date":"2016-01-04"}

I can't have fun with \"Ariel.\" This is a very serious, sad, profound, lyrical, life changing book of poems, that only comes around once in a lifetime, and should be read over and over. There is not enough to say about the austere beauty of these suicidal poems, balancing life with art, and losing. They somehow cling to tradition while at the same time breaking from it, and all but redefined poetry maybe to the present. The ones that stand out the most are \"Daddy,\" about her father as a Nazi; \"Tulips\" about the beautiful color red when Plath tries killing herself, and \"Ariel\" a sad little hymn to waking up, but I'm not remembering them all, and if there ever was a book of poetry that should be read from beginning to end this is it.

{"book_id":"20821284","rating":4,"review_text":"This is a book about the author's childhood written in beautiful verses. As a young child, Woodson had to move with her mother from Ohio to Greensville to New York. In Greensville, her grandfather took on the role of their father and their grandmother was their teacher. At the time, African Americans are protesting for segregation and they learned about the marching from their grandfather. Their grandparents had great influences on their childhood by telling stories and reading bible to them. Her grandmother was very faithful to her God, and most of the nights in a week the children will do something related to religion. Woodson even wrote down that's how she learned about days in a week. And because of their belief, being Jehova's Witnesses had also shaped their childhood. In \"Because We're Witnesses\", she wrote \"No Halloween. No Christmas. No Birthday...No voting. No fighting. No cursing. No Wars.\" (164). There are also verses that show her early interest in words and story. For example, \"Composition Notebook\" and \"On Paper\", Woodson describes how she was enchanted by letters and white pages (154-156). And in \"Believing\", Woodson would make up stories that she got ideas from her uncle singing (175). One of my favorite is \"The Candy Lady\" (71). I can just see three little kids following their grandpa, not talking, and slurping up the melting ice cream. This book shows where the author comes from and recorded a period of time and lifestyle in the past. The words of this book create images that are so vivid for the readers to picture in their heads.","date":"2016-04-26"}

Tak perlu membaca berulang kali untuk memahami maknanya, namun inilah letak kelebihannya. Bahasa yang sederhana, malah cenderung seperti sedang bercerita, membuat saya bisa duduk termenung ketika sedang meresapi karyanya. Sebagian besar puisi-puisi karya peraih penghargaan Qantas Spirit of Youth ini mengangkat tema cinta. Meski judulnya mengungkit kata 'Kesialan-kesialan', bukanlah kegagalan dan patah hati yang menjadi spirit utama.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"I would like to start off this review by saying that I've never been the biggest fan of poetry. I shied away from it. I was scared by it. I think some part of me always equated poetry with the ones that we studied in school. You know, the ones that we were forced to read and analyze every word, sentence, and punctuation. I can appreciate poetry, but it was never something that I really found myself gravitating towards. \n I'll be honest, the book's cover really called out to me. I knew nothing about it, but I thought the cover was pretty so I picked it up. I flipped through it, and it seemed interesting enough so I eventually bought it. It is a fairly short poetry collection. Something you could probably finish in a day, but why would you? I wanted to take my time with this to make sure that every word sunk in. If you couldn't tell already, I seriously loved this. I loved the story and the journey Rupi Kaur took me on. It was heartbreaking and uplifting, and it also gave me some nice reminders of the person I want to be. \n I was reading through some of the reviews, and I can understand why some people didn't enjoy it. I am firm believer that stories come to you when you need it most, and this is one of those times. For first time poetry readers, like myself, I feel like this was a great collection to start with. \n 10/10","date":"2017-05-22"}

Nonetheless, the book has received a wide audience owing to its tone and simplicity; with people praising it as a collection of poems easy to understand. \n Most poems in the book are in the form of lyric poetry, expressing strong thoughts and feelings; a form common to contemporary poems. A few poems seem to have a modernist approach, with contrasting images merged together. For instance, the imagery of loving someone is contrasted with an image of 'doing dishes'. Some poems. however, miss the modernist approach and leave dental hygiene to the mercy of love. \n READ COMPLETE REVIEW HERE: http://anoshoflife.com/blog/love-and-...","date":"2016-06-08"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"98% (my original review for some reason didn't upload properly :/) \n I absolutely LOVED this it was unlike anything I have ever read. It was incredibly deep and insightful. \n Although, I had little or none experience in some of the topics these poems covered, I still really enjoyed them. They let me see through the eyes of someone who has gone through those things. \n And some of the poems I could really relate to. I realized that so many of these poems reflected parts of my life that I even sometimes try not to think about. But there were also poems that talked about things that I constantly think about, and it was nice to know that I'm not the only one who has that sort of stuff go through their mind. \n I HIGHLY recommend everyone should read this book. It will make you see things in a new light and have more sympathy for those who have, and are still going through some of the things these poems discuss. And if you are someone who has gone through any of the things this book of poems presents, I hope you can find hope in this book, to know that what you are going through you are not going through alone. That you can make it. <3 \n I actually think that everyone can find something that relates to them in this book. Because there are not only poems about deep and serious stuff, but also things that are less serious, but are still things that very much affect people, things I'm more than sure everyone once or more has felt. \n I personally feel that I read this book at the right time. Things in my life at the moment are just really everywhere, and reading this book really put things into perspective for me. I'm planning on re reading this book in the future when my current life problems have gone away and see if the same poems that I relate to now, I relate to in the future. And to see what poems affect me then, when I have other things going on in my life.","date":"2016-09-18"}

Identity is explored through our main \"protagonist\" Hamlet, and is foiled by numerous characters. We strive to be Fortinbras, the physically strong hero ; with a bit of motivation he can conquer any piece of land. We see ourselves as the obedient, (once) innocent, and trapped Ophelia. We all attempt to stay true to ourselves like Laertes, even when poisonous thoughts enter our mind.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"**RATING: 4.5/5** \n Right, so a lot of people have been criticising this book for not being 'real poetry.' It's considered 'too Tumblr', or is regarded as 'poorly written' for not containing many 'real' poetic devices. The reviewers with this line of thinking usually go on to recommend other 'real' poets such as Syliva Plath, Emily Dickinson, Emily Berry, Edgar Allen Poe, Carol Ann Duffy, etc. \n To that, I would like to say that there is no such thing as a 'real' poet-- it's entirely subjective. Even after reading the works of all of the aforementioned poets and more (Charles Bukowski was another popular suggestion -- I've read some of his works, too), I still prefer the work of Rupi. \n I want to make it clear that I think ALL of the above poets are talented. The other poets that I have mentioned do have more 'colourful' poems in terms of imagery, showing and not telling; the themes discussed. However, a poet's ability to use such devices (for me) isn't entirely what makes a 'good' poet. \n If you're solely after eloquent metaphors/imagery in a poem, regardless of the poem's theme/how accessible it may be to you,then maybe Rupi's book is not for you. Instead, I would suggest reading works from any of the above poets, as I found that I could appreciate their works for how well-crafted they were (although, at times, I did find Rupi's imagery to be quite striking). \n If, however, you like to read poems that you can easily relate to; with deeper meanings that are easier to grasp, and you appreciate the beautiful simplicity in which these ideas can be expressed, then I would recommend reading 'Milk and Honey.' I found that while Rupi's language wasn't the most eloquent or 'grand' on the whole, her work was highly emotive. She also has a talent for putting into words the things that not all of us can easily express; she does so powerfully. \n I think that whether or not you will like this book really depends on what you look for in a poet. To me, this was such a thought-provoking collection, and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.","date":"2017-04-20"}

Ultimately, my reasoning for reading the collection of poems was to select an appropriate poem for my text transformation for my A Level English Coursework; I consequently decided on 'Daddy'. \n Plath's gritty and raw material was echoed so vibrantly throughout every poem I almost felt like she was speaking to me herself. I was interested by 'Daddy' and Plath's links to Nazi Germany (some of the poem being in German, and mentioning Auschwitz) and her omniscient style of narrator echoing her opinion of her father into the narrator of the poem. \n However, not being a ridiculously huge poem fan I didn't pine for the return to my book, and ultimately in the wrong mood, Plath's poems could bring my mood down quite a substantial amount, but is that what Plath intended? \n Despite this, I still aspire to read 'The Bell Jar' by Plath and many of her other literary works and enjoyed transforming her poem into a monologue in the style of 'The Vagina Monologues' for my coursework.","date":"2016-01-31"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"I went into reading 'Milk and Honey' having known Rupi Kaur through her photography and her position as an advocate to end the shame surrounding periods. What I found is a book of poetry so rich and full about all the struggles women go through life. Some I could relate to. Some I could not (due to my heritage in comparison to Rupi Kaur). But what I didn't know I learnt from. And what I did know gave back that feeling that is hard to describe, but maybe is best described as being like honey to honour Rupi Kaur. As the feeling I am describing is both sweet and familiar, and also soothing just like honey. It is that feeling you have when you have read something that reflects back an experience you have also had and makes you no longer feel alone. \n What Rupi Kaur has written I think intends to do just that, which you can see by the different subsections she chose to categorise her poetry by: 'the hurting', 'the loving', 'the breaking', 'the healing'. Also, her poetry although devastatingly brutal at times is easy to read if you are not used to poetry. Or are new to poetry. As if I am being honest, although there are some poems I love; poetry has never been my go to option. I've never been able to have the same sustained connection with poetry, as I have been able to have with novels. \n However, as 'Milk and Honey' depicts a journey through poems it provides a narrative and so a safe, similar space that us novel readers are used to feeling. Not that of course this is anything new for books of poetry, but when thinking of narrative poems; many people probably remember the long poems written in old English that they used to struggle with. Here is instead something you can sink your teeth into with being an english student. \n However, all the while you are reading Rupi Kaur manages to sink her teeth right back into you. Partly, because there is an undeniable sensual edge to a lot of the poems that is open and unafraid (and of course makes me slightly uncomfortable to talk about just because that's who I am) in its explicitness. \n Rupi's poems reflect how in recent years there has been an increasing movement of women taking back their sexuality and talking about it openly and honestly. Including the highs and the lows, and what sexuality is like for women from their own perspective. Rather, than the male lens that is constantly thrown on sexuality. \n I think in the end what I take from 'Milk and Honey' is that you can always rebuild yourself back up and start anew. You can change the way you think. About yourself. About other women. Don't let anyone ever make you think you can't. It's never too late to change the way you think. We can all heal (as cheesy as that sounds). \n Whether you can relate to the struggles that Rupi Kaur covers such as bad relationships, father issues, the way women are sexualised within society, or not, 'Milk and Honey' delivers Rupi Kaur's perspective of being a woman. Read it if you can't relate and prepare to cry if you can. \n Review is extracts of my longer blog post about the book, which you can read here: https://aprilisthecruellestmonth.org/...","date":"2017-05-03"}

{"book_id":"45974","rating":5,"review_text":"I picked up this book after a quote from it appeared in a horoscope I was reading, a quote that certainly applied to me. It also interested me because Pessoa is Portuguese, and my mother is Portuguese. \n The Book of Disquiet is a dark, rambling and moody autobiographical account of a character named Bernando Soares, a lonely introspective clerk whose room looks out upon the Rua dos Douradores in Portugal. Loneliness, sadness, dreams and imagination are some of the themes in this philosophical memoir. This novel is certainly autobiographical; it is well-known that Pessoa created many different personas in his writings. Beautifully written, this classic contains many beautiful and amazing quotes--one of these: \"Our soul's great anxieties are always cosmic cataclysms, upsetting the stars all around us and making the sun veer off course\"(142).","date":"2016-01-30"}

{"book_id":"45974","rating":5,"review_text":"This time it was Fernando Pessoa's The book of disquiet, a posthumous collection of the Portuguese poet's prose from manuscripts he worked on with that title in mind from 1913 until his death in 1935. As the title suggests, it is pretty down-in-the-mouth, a vast series of ruminations on introspection, depression and misanthropy, put into the mouth of a sort of alter-ego, or 'heteronym' called Soares. Soares is a book-keeper in a firm in Lisbon. He has some colleagues and a couple of aunts who play solitaire all the time. He writes without hope of publication, expressing quite callous opinions on the character of his fellow men. (Pessoa's idea of inventing names as the authors of his poems (and, in this case, prose) and calling them 'heteronyms' as opposed to pseudonyms, has become a famous cultural device, uniquely attributed to him.) \n So, what did we think? Hadn't Malcolm read somewhere that this was among the most popular choices of readers' groups? Mmm. Sara declared she was glad she had read at least some of it. Malcolm thought that was the right approach. It should come with a health warning: do not attempt to devour this whole. But Sara didn't blame Pessoa. After all, it wasn't published in his lifetime. \n Here's the problem, you have to admire the sheer exquisite expression of introspection, depression and misanthropy, relentlessly repeated. You could easily take the mickey. Take Tim's comparison of the narrator's character with Eeyore, a pessimistic, gloomy, depressed, anhedonic, old grey stuffed donkey from AA Milne's Winnie the Pooh. This started everyone off making weird comparisons. Montaigne? Why had Malcolm thought of him? Well, some of Pessoa's stuff reads like essays (Montaigne invented them) and then you've got Pessoa's 'I am, in large measure, the selfsame prose I write...' versus Montaigne's 'I am myself the matter of my book.' \n Try Woody Allen, Sara suggested: 'Eternity is a long time, especially at the end'. Or Oscar Wilde: 'To love oneself is the beginning of a life-long romance.' More seriously, Samuel Beckett's The umnamable had come to mind, and of course Constantine Cavafy, the Greek poet, had been a civil servant, little published during his lifetime. Pessoa's near-contemporary, glasses, moustache, collar, tie. She'd liked Pessoa's acute perceptions but acknowledged that it was difficult to write about tedium and depression without being tedious and depressing. \n Malcolm had been reminded of Flaubert too. Elitist transgressive. Compare Pessoa's Advice to unhappily married women (imagine your regular marital sex is with another man) with Flaubert's Dictionnaire des idees recues (received wisdom is all perverse) It was all about rising above it all. But what was it, about rising so unsympathetically? As in declaring '...a deep and weary disdain for all those who work for mankind, for all those who fight for their country and give their lives so that civilization may continue.' This at the time of the First World War during which 12,000 Portuguese troops and 220,000 civilians died, according to the record. \n Whether or not Pessoa is putting words in his character's mouth which he would not own up to personally, he was, according to his biography, an enthusiast of kinds of elitist stuff like occultism (exchanged letters with Aleister Crowley) and spiritualism. He was a monarchist and supported Salazar's dictatorship for a while. When Salazar finally had him banned it wasn't for for being opposed to the regime, but for writing in defence of freemasonry! \n Where had we come across Pessoa before? In 2013. We read Antonio Tabucchi's Pereira maintains, his account of an anomic Portuguese journalist finally spurred into action by the fate of young people resisting the Salazar regime. We noted then that Tabucchi maybe had Pessoa in mind (he was a Pessoa expert) and that 'Pessoa, in his poems, was quite capable of appreciating the urgency of social strife and turning up his nose at it.' Sounds about right.","date":"2017-03-15"}

{"book_id":"1420","rating":5,"review_text":"Son las primeras 5 estrellas que doy a una obra literaria, no me gusta mucho darlas porque es como decir que la obra es perfecta o casi perfecta pero es que William Shakespeare se lo merece, y que mejor que Hamlet para otorgarselas. \n Tal y como se dice en la obra, el teatro es un reflejo, un espejo de la vida, y Shakespeare sabe reflejar la vida, las pasiones y las motivaciones humanas de una forma que es un placer sensitivo leerlo. Siempre he pensado que para leer a Shakespeare uno no solo debe tener practica leyendo, pues tiene un lenguaje y estructuras de palabras bastante complejas, sino que debe haber hecho una muy profunda introspeccion sobre si mismo y sobre la vida para entender a los personajes. En la obra se reflexiona y se habla profundamente sobre la muerte, la venganza, la locura; siempre incomprendida ella, la lujuria, el ansia de poder, el dolor, el amor en muchos de sus ambitos, de Dios, del destino (Llamado Fortuna en la obra) y un muy largo etc de temas, tal y como la vida misma. \n Que decir de los personajes, todos bastante buenos, pero en especial tendria que nombrar a Ofelia y a Hamlet, los dos caen victimas de la \"locura\" y bendita \"locura\" la suya, sobretodo la de Hamlet que es muy mordaz y a mi me encanta la ironia. La ambientacion es sublime creo que Shakespeare no podria haber elegido mejor escenario y mejores motivaciones para su historia y la prosa y la forma en la que se van desarrollando los hechos son magnificos. \n En fin no me voy a entretener mucho mas pues hay gente que sabra mucho mas que yo sobre esta obra, dado que yo algunas cosas me ha costado pillarlas, supongo que todavia me falta madurez mental, espiritual y literaria, espero que dentro de un tiempo cuando vuelva a encontrarme con esta obra, la disfrute y entienda mucho mas.","date":"2016-04-06"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"last week, i attended a poetry panel discussion which rupi kaur participated in. and being an amateur poet myself, i loved every part of the panel, even when the arab authors spoke, and i had no translator. one of the things rupi said which stuck with me most was: (paraphrased) \"when i was young, i would sit in english class, marvelling in the poetry, and yet not understanding the poem in itself. i had no idea what the poet wanted to say.\" \n and so after reading some the goodreads reviews on milk & honey i must admit i'm disappointed many people didn't agree with what's undoubtedly a universal theme that rupi tackles through her poetry. she makes it clear that she wants her poetry to resound through communities, firstly, that of women, and secondly, that of colored women. her work has been labelled numerous times as feminist poetry, and i can't not agree. being a woc intersectional feminist, i'm so proud of rupi for tackling issues like rape, eurocentric beauty standards, self-love (my personal favorite collection), even body hair through short & crisp sentences -- issues my women struggle with so much, silently. she's no shakespeare, or wordsworth, or tagore; there's no need for her to be tied down to the limits of poetry. i feel so reassured knowing my people have produced a poet like rupi kaur, a poet for everyone. \n (another problem i have with reviews is all those throwing around the word \"Tumblr\", like that is the best thing that describes her work. Tumblr is not a genre, there is no seeming resemblance to the web blog, and even if you do see it, stop devising it as a way to disregard her art. her art is in fact, true art, in its true definition.)","date":"2016-11-11"}

{"book_id":"6295","rating":5,"review_text":"Ginsberg's oeuvre has been uneven, but Howl is his best, and most famous poem, a stunning, powerful and radical piece of work buoyed by an electric undercurrent of energy and anger, and hallucinatory imagery. It is unlike anything previously written, taking off with its famous opening line : \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness...\" - and continuing at a breath-taking pace. It is the story of Ginsberg and his friends - Kerouac, Cassady, Burroughs, Huncke, et al - but also a diatribe against the evils of capitalist America. Ironically, the 1950s in America is widely considered to be a dull and placid time, but in fact the era was brimming with radical change, giving us teenagers, rock'n'roll, classic films like On the Waterfront, Some Like it Hot, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and others, icons like Elvis, Brando, Dean, and Monroe, plus the Beats, who morphed into the Hippies and the whole counter culture of the 1960s, out of which sprang virtually all the protest and social movements of today, from Occupy to the environmentalists. When I was a teenager in New York in the 60s, I happened upon Ginsberg one afternoon near Washington Square Park and read him one of my poems. In truth it wasn't a very good poem, but Ginsberg was kind enough to listen to it and give me a rapid-fire poetry lesson on the spot as I struggled to keep pace with him, urging me to be more descriptive: \"Describe everything you see - the people, the pavement, the grass, the colour of the sky,\" etc., he told me as we weaved briskly through the Village streets. (An incident, btw, I recount in my graphic novel Giraffes in my Hair: A Rock'n'Roll Life, drawn by my partner Carol Swain). \n A lovely man, and an often great poet.","date":"2016-10-03"}

{"book_id":"30119","rating":3,"review_text":"BR.3 \n Where the sidewalk ends \n Shel silverstein \n \"There is a place where the sidewalk ends \n And before the street begins, \n And there the grass grows soft and white, \n And there the sun burns crimson bright, \n And there the moon-bird rests from his flight \n To cool in the peppermint wind \n Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black \n And the dark street winds and bends. \n Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow \n We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow, \n And watch where the chalk-white arrows go \n To the place where the sidewalk ends \n Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow, \n And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go, \n For the children, they mark, and the children, they know \n The place where the sidewalk ends.\" \n I love where the sidewalk ends by Shel Silverstein. This is a beautiful poetry book that is so simple that children can enjoy it. It also has poems that gives us different meaning as we grow older. I am doing this review for a grade so I won't be as much of a fan-girl as I usually am. I am going to give you some boring facts I am supposed to include for my teacher. This book is 309 pages long. This book is poetry. Now then let us move on to literary elements. \n For starters this is a poetry book, and there are so many poems with so many things to learn, 1-15 things each poem can teach us. So I don't want to start with \"these are the morals or values we can take out of this book\". It's too hard. \n So what other literary elements can I talk about? I don't know... What about character growth, oh crap there are so many characters and not enough growth that we can see very much change. Unless I was to look at each poem individually. But there is a lot of characters and bits of growth here and there. \n So I am going to talk about voice. Shel Silverstein's voice is so unique in his writings. All of the different shows a bit of a different side to him. Such as: \"I will not play at tug o'war I'd rather play at hug o' war,Where everyone hugs, Instead of tugs Where everyone giggles And rolls on the rug, Where everyone kisses And everyone grins And everyone cuddles And everyone wins.\" This poem is so cute! But there are not as cute poems such as \"I am writing these poems From inside a lion, And it's rather dark in here. So please excuse the handwriting Which may not be too clear. But this afternoon by the lion's cage I'm afraid I got too near. And I'm writing these lines From inside a lion, And it's rather dark in here.\" As we can see that this is not as cute as Hug o war. This poem is talking about being eaten by a lion and still writing poems. We can also see that there is a different voice, the first example sound more like a child to me, and the second example I have given sound more like an adult. The voice of writing changes through the different poems, but they all have that Silverstein sound to them. \n I would say that this book is amazing. It is an easy read. I think it's great for kids and adults who need a laugh or just need a book to fall in love with. It is an amazing read.","date":"2016-11-20"}

What a wonderful present it was. \n As a buddhist who grew up in a christian household, there were many topics covered by both religions that were present within its pages. I found the book extremely refreshing. It was concise, poetic, and provided simplistic wisdom on issues we tend to overthink. \n The cons about this book revolve around how short it is. Although there is much wisdom and insight within its pages, there is little to no explanation on how each understanding was realized. This will leave some to view the book as preachy and some as insightful but only because they have come to this understanding previously. \n Overall a very pleasant read. It simply is the story of a man sharing his understanding of life.

In fact the tales are in the form of verses, typically poems. It takes you from a land filled with gadget gazing to a world of ancient English when words are spelled as they sound.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"This is a very easy read. I read it in 45 minutes. It's a very well written book of poetry. I am in a healthy, happy, loving relationship, so the \"breaking\" section of this book didn't really resonate with me as much as it would with others. For instance, those I know who have been through difficult breakups would really benefit from reading this book. It talks about the importance of self-love in a simple way. Some lines are very impactful and memorable. Overall it's a really great book, I just think it would impact various people differently depending on what they've been through in their life (rape, abuse, an absent father figure, messy breakup, etc). I could see why this would only impact a certain group of people- the broken, damaged souls. For those that this book does touch, it touches the deepest part of you. I related to most sections except for the one about \"the breaking\". I see myself coming back to this book the next time I'm going through a difficult time in my life.","date":"2016-12-15"}

{"book_id":"76889","rating":5,"review_text":"I've been thinking lately how most of my life I dreamed I would live in a shack in the mountains without telephone or T.V., walk the woods, eat berries, drink snowmelt, and write about place. I would of course visit a city on the weekends, for culture, you know, and sit on an unmade bed in an inexpensive hotel in the afternoon and watch soap operas on T.V. Seriously though, the culture part of the dream includes art, ballet, theatre, cinema, fine cuisine, wine, friends, a love interest, a once a week teaching job--then back to the shack for a week of writing and communing with the natural world. When I lived alone and single, which I have most of my life, it was easy to continue the shack dream, because by living alone, I was closer to that person on the mountain. Since I have been married though, the hermit of me has hid, or should I say, reclused, but did not completely disappear. He lurks among my cortical synopses, resides in my hippocampus. He and the shack where he lives will be a part of my life's work. For a writer, there has to be a balance between writing and life. Some writers need more of one than the other. They way I see it, a writer may try to live a full life and write, but when the time comes to write, he needs to write, and only write. The writing has to be more important than life when he is writing about life. And (now I am getting away from the topic, but drawing a parallel), depending how private the writer is, a writer may want to edit, exclude, or delete his life from history and leave only his writings. Sooner or later, though, someone is going to tell his story--that is, what he did, how he treated people--and that someone may be his mother, his sister, his spouse, his child, his friend, his enemy, or his dumped lover (any of whom may not be very kind); so why shouldn't a writer keep a diary, talk to people, interview, write letters--tell his side of the story. If he lived a good life (and that is, of course, a subjective phrase dependent upon cultural mores, subcultural trends, parental teachings, etc. etc.), he shouldn't be ashamed about people knowing about his life. He shouldn't be afraid. Not if he has courage. Anyway, along those lines (and I have to focus on the shack--place), let's see how life develops, you and I, the reader and the writer, let's see how our poems appear, how we diarize and how we are biographed. On those notes, let's look at a book: \n . \n Last week, I read e.e. cummings's 100 Selected Poems. He's a god of course who visited this earth to show off and play with people's heads. Anyone could aspire to write half as well as him. He breaks downs language only to rebuild it to high art.","date":"2017-08-06"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":5,"review_text":"It was November 2014 when Rupi Kaur self-published her first collection titled 'Milk and Honey', a collection of poems and prose about struggles and life. The collection is divided into four chapters: the hurting, the loving, the breaking, and the healing which individually denotes the author's experience in love, loss, pain, and recovery. \n NOTABLE PASSAGES: \n I honestly prefer every poem and prose written on this book as notable because they really are. Every single line denotes Kaur's deep emotions. It almost as if the poem was meant for me, as if I was struggle the same or as if I've experienced the same. \n WHAT I LOVED ABOUT THIS BOOK: \n I loved the fact that this book is self-published. Before, I thought self-published books couldn't make it to the market. I thought people only turn their attention to books from well-known publishers and that if your book doesn't belong there, people might just ditch them. I don't want that to happen. I want my future book to be read by people. Rupi Kaur has enlightened me, given me courage to just keep on doing what I love, expect less and simply, see the outcome. \n I don't know why Kaur didn't prefer to have a publisher or maybe like me, she doesn't have the courage to try sending her manuscript. Her reasons may vary and it's okay. Consequently, when Milk and Honey became a success, it leads her to Andrew McMeel publishing releasing it under their name on October 2015. \n Overall, just like what I've mentioned on my preferred notable passages, I loved every single thing in this book: the illustrations which are personally illustrated by her, the lines, its structure and the plain black cover of this book. \n DO I WANT TO SEE THIS ON BIG-SCREEN? \n The idea of violence, loss, heartbreak, how an individual survives all of those pains is definitely a good concept for people to watch. I don't know how they are going to create an adaptation of this, maybe a theatre musical or a theatre acts will do since it's a collection of prose and poems. Yes, I'd love to see it on big-screen. \n WILL I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL AGES? \n No. The concept is too mature for very young readers. I think they could just tell what this book is all about in a simple and nice way, in that way, they will understand the book. \n RATINGS: 5 stars for the concept/idea, 4 stars for the plain black cover with honey bees, 5 stars on the contents, various prose and poems.","date":"2017-04-16"}

{"book_id":"15997","rating":5,"review_text":"** spoiler alert ** \n Well, I will start by saying that PARADISE LOST is heavy, confrontational and controversial, in all the best ways. \"(>[?]<)noAnd while, sure, it can be viewed as just a great piece of writing, I think it's full awesomeness lies in its ability to trigger deep reflection on your fundamental beliefs about good-and-evil, heroes-and-villains, identity... you know, the deep stuff. (*'V`*) \n One of the beauties of PARADISE LOST is the multiple layers of double meanings. ( ' V ` ) Of course, this makes it a bit of a tricky read. (*i_*i)? I found it best to read in chunks, rather than line by line; the sentence structures are totally funky and the word order doesn't seem to matter much - verbs, especially, pop up in strange places a lot, and sometimes words are left out completely and you have to guess what would be there. It's a very... allusive style. ( ) ? But I love how the weird structure and wording allows freedom of interpretation, and multi-meaning actually becomes a technique that adds depth. We are reading about an ethereal world after all. If the sentences weren't structured so weird, I think it would lose a lot of its impact. (-V-) \n Because I had so much fun with this poem, I just can't bring myself to even attempt to write a review for the whole thing in 1000words, so I'll just concentrate on BOOK ONE for now - later BOOKS I'll review in my blog =) \n BOOK ONE is the middle of the PARADISE LOST story, and has three - unofficial - parts. In the first part - the introduction, so to speak - Milton introduced the subject of the poem as man's sin and eventual redemption. He also states his purpose to be justifying God's actions. Part two starts the story with Satan and his angels, immediately after their banishment to Hell. The angels are remorseful of their rebellion, but Satan rallies them and they once again prepare for war - though a different kind this time. In the final section, we have the revitalized angels building Pandemonium and transforming Hell into a - dare I say - magnificent place. \n The tone of the poem is true to its form: 'epic'. o(>=V<=)o It's set up as a kind of tragedy right from the get-go - with the bringing of \"death into the world and all our woe\" (line3). But don't panic, it is not without humor. The tragedy is double-dipped in irony, with a sprinkling of mockery, and I'm sure I spotted a few puns. .;( ;^[?]^;);.There is also a peculiar, inspirational quality, a hope for the future. A technique that particularly caught my eye was how present descriptions of Satan and his angel are presented in terms of who they will be and what will happen, it's an interesting play with time. Of course, since we are talking about the rise of Satan and Hell's angels, the hope is not without irony. \n Further irony is found in our hero. All epics have a hero, right? Well, our hero is Satan. Yep, the devil is our hero. Surprise! (o_O) ! Well, he's a kind of tragic hero, but we are lured into admiring him - an unsettling experience, I have to say. (;)\" He is magnificent; his words are driven and courageous; his defiance and hatred are presented as strength. \"All is not lost; the unconquerable will,/And study of revenge, immortal hate,/and courage never to submit or yield.\" He accepts tragedy, rejecting forgiveness as submission, and submission as dishonorable. He embraces Hell, determined to turn his 'demotion' into his ultimate triumph. \"The mind is its own place, and in itself/ Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n,\" (254-255). It is a discomfortingly appealing representation of Satan, and yet what makes more sense than for the great deceiver to be a handsome, charismatic, smooth-talker? +() V) )+ There is also irony in that Satan's words have the power to take away the pain and helplessness of those he has enticed into damnation with him. (-_-) \n So, what are Satan's angels like? Well, interestingly, rather than being depicted as the classic demons, these angels are... well, angelic. ('~` ) They play trumpets, move to the sound of soft flutes, wield glowing weapons, and are depicted in fables and romances. The greatest of Hell's angels even rise to 'greatness', becoming the pagan gods. In the style of the old epics, the highest angels/demi-gods are listed in a catalogue of heroes. There is an interesting duel-effect here. By being described 'as gods' and listed in the way of heroes, the angels are presented as both mighty and rather pathetic. +( V , V )+ They are worshiped, but they are also pretenders, trying and failing to live up to the true God; and in being listed as heroes, the difference between them and true heroes is only accentuated. \n The hero catalogue also serves another purpose, raising some rather confronting questions about identity. Identity is a heavy theme in BOOK ONE. The angels were stripped of their names when they were cast out of heaven, and they already had no gender, arguably two of the most fundamental means of identification. Yet, it is only after they have no identity that they rise to be as gods. The poem also makes a point of drawing a link between the angels having no gender and their purity. \"For spirits when they please/Can either sex assume, or both; so soft/And uncompounded is their essence pure\". It could, then, be interpreted that to commit to a gender would be to contaminate their purity. So, by this interpretation, when the angels become the pagan gods and take the form of gender and assume new names, they lose the last of their purity. (no_<. ) \n The link between names and identity is also demonstrated in how Milton refers to Satan and God. 'The Devil' has hundreds of years of connotations that would distract from Milton's representation. Milton never refers to Satan as 'the Devil', instead he calls him the Superior Fiend, Arch-Enemy, Dread Commander. Consequently, instead of hearing \"devil\" and seeing \"pitchforks and evil grins\", Milton gives us fresh names and, therefore, a fresh image of his tragic hero. God, meanwhile, is Living Strength, Omnipotent, Eternal Judgement, Creator. From these names we can gather that, while God is playing a less prominent role in the story at this point, he is still the most powerful, most revered, and certainly still the good guy of the story. \n Moving on to part three, we have the angels building Pandemonium out of gold they mine from hell. As the love of gold is the root of all evil, having Hell's capital made of the precious metal rather than molten lava has its own eeriness. {{ (>_<) }} Pandemonium is a beautiful place, and the fallen angels sit as heroes in grand halls. Its gates are also wide, making it easy to enter, unlike the straight and narrow way into heaven. Something I found interesting to note was that the angels worked hard for the gold, and worked hard to build the capital, making an interesting point about being saved by works; you can put in great effort, and you will be rewarded with the works of your hands, but that doesn't mean you'll get to heaven. \n Well, I haven't succeeded in keeping to 1000 words, so I better wrap it up - and somehow this became more of an analysis than a review. (//V//) But, seriously, PARADISE LOST: BOOK ONE is awesome! ('_`) I totally recommend it! It is a great read, it's well written, deeply thought out, with just the right amount of the challenging and controversial. \n So, yes, definitely worth a perfect score. \\(-V-)/","date":"2017-03-22"}

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":3,"review_text":"When I first began reading milk and honey, I felt like the prose and poetry was simply too pretentious and bombastic, and that none of this was going to appeal to me in any way. However, as I continued to flick through the pages, one passage would catch my eye and appeal to my introspective side; then another, and another, until I was hooked. I'm aware that it seems to be aimed at a female demographic, following a distinctly feminine perspective throughout, but there were plenty of ambiguous passages that either sex could relate to. I finished the book in one sitting, partially sad that it was over, but thankful that I'd listened to other people's advice on getting it as soon as I could.","date":"2017-05-31"}

{"book_id":"12914","rating":4,"review_text":"The epic itself is 5 stars, since there's almost nothing I would rather read and I have the privilege of teaching it in depth every year. \n Any translation, however, is going to be less than that, and any criticism of Fitzgerald's is tempered by appreciation, since, as the version that I inherited and used in class for over ten years, his readings have often fundamentally shaped my view of Virgil's text even where I disagree with his renderings. \n A main drawback is one that most translations suffer from: length. Only, I think, Sarah Ruden and Frederick Ahl have kept their English versions to the same number of lines as the Latin; most others, including Fitzgerald's, tend to expand the number of lines by 25% or more. For example, Fitzgerald's Book 8 in 992 lines, which is over 35% longer than the original 731. This gives Fitzgerald an expansive and discursive feel in place of Vergil's compact and focused voice. Practically, it also makes it difficult to compare Fitzgerald to the Latin, which should always be done with a translation. \n But there are also key errors that obscure Vergil's meaning. For example, Fitzgerald renders 11.782's (femineo praedae et spoliorum...amore) with \"in a girl's love of finery\" (at his line 1065!), which should be something more like \"with a womanish love of plunder and spoils.\" In this line, Vergil is most clearly reversing the value structure of the Homeric epic by saying that the pursuit of spoils, so central to the heroic ethic in Homer, is characteristic not of an manly hero, but of a woman. No translation can render the original perfectly, but one should not render the original with its opposite meaning. \n Nevertheless, I remain deeply appreciative of Fitzgerald's work as the door through which I and hundreds of students have come to Vergil: he is a poet, while I am just a pedant.","date":"2017-07-06"}

Being in my early 20s I understand the mindset she was in when she wrote this but I really hoped that the poetry would take me on another journey besides feeling soulless after a heartbreak. \n Most people complained about the lack of punctuation and her lowercase style but I know those people probably didn't read into the back story of why she does that so it's not much of a problem for me.

{"book_id":"23513349","rating":4,"review_text":"I suppose that the four stars comes from the immense relatability that I find in this book, and how it left an unforgettable emotional impact on me. It's a light read. I finished it in about two days. When I turned the final page, so many things were running through my head, and I couldn't decide whether I was joyous or sorrowful. It was nice to know that I wasn't the only one out there who had gone through such things as Kaur had. I didn't feel alone after having read this, and something about Kaur's writing leaves you feeling unstoppable. \n But \n relatability aside \n I struggle \n to find \n real poem structure here \n Now, for the negative part. While I myself may be s*** at writing poetry, that doesn't mean I don't know what a good poem looks like. As far as structure and grammar, it's admittedly unlike anything I've ever seen, and makes me wonder if I simply haven't read enough poetry yet or if Kaur truly can't write with decent composition. Some pages are not even poems, but mere \"walls of text\" or single sentences. It's a little odd, honestly. When I first opened up this book, I genuinely couldn't tell if it was poetry or if I was just a dumbass who doesn't know poetry when he sees it. \n Kaur makes up for this with her raw, heartfelt message. I don't find books with messages like this that often, if at all. But, as I stated prior to this, I find it highly relatable, so perhaps I am biased in writing this review. This book seems to create very divided opinions, with people either loving it or hating it. I'd say I'm in-between. Nevertheless, I think this book is worth picking up, and there's probably something in it for everybody.

A collection of poetry, prose, and hand-drawn illustrations, the book has four chapters dealing with four common issues developing in a young mind. These are titled as \"the hurting\", \"the loving\", \"the breaking\", and \"the healing\". The author designed the book from cover to cover, illustrating pictures that were woven in with her words. \n The hurting describes different emotions of a female mind and body, about the silence a girl learns from her mother, the inappropriate touch by the males and the pain of a heaving chest radiating to down there. \n The loving expresses the unconditional love of a mother who gives her everything (mind, body, soul) in bringing a new life into this world. The loving shows the passion of a couple which lays hidden during an argument but emerges out erotically on making up. \n The breaking will capture your mind, the wilting love will make you travel back to all those relationships where you forgot to breathe and the words will help you find solace no matter it all ended. Eventually it will leave you with a smile and praise for the author. \n The healing will teach you to believe first in your own self because that is the moment when you rehabilitate back into the world, your heart mends slowly, your mind feels healthy and you feel blissful. \n From the book- \n the thing about having \n an alcoholic parent \n is an alcoholic parent \n does not exist \n simply \n an alcoholic \n who could not stay sober \n long enough to raise their kids (39) \n what am i to you he asks \n i put my hands in his lap \n and whisper you \n are every hope \n i've ever had \n in human form (49) \n the very thought of you \n has my legs spread apart \n like an easel with a canvas \n begging for art (57) \n you might not have been my first love \n but you were the love that made \n all the other loves \n irrelevant (63) \n it wasn't you i was kissing \n - don't be mistaken \n it was him on my mind \n your lips were just convenient (113) \n i don't know why \n i split myself open \n for others knowing \n sewing myself up \n hurts this much \n afterward (125) \n perhaps the saddest of all \n are those who live waiting \n for someone they're not \n sure exists \n - 7 billion people (157) \n for you to see beauty here \n does not mean \n there is beauty in me \n it means there is beauty rooted \n so deep within you \n you can't help but \n see it everywhere (192) \n These are just a few words I shared here but there is a whole new world in the book.

I suddenly realized religion is poetry. \"The Gay Science\" is poetry itself in all its forms. This is where Nietzsche introduces his controversial concept \"God is dead!\" which has won both acclaim and disavowal. Regardless it is not understood. It's essential mystery is in its being vague and haphazardly pieced together so you can't look at one passage to understand it. This is a theme throughout Nietzsche's work. I imagine his father's death at age 8 caused his reflections to move in morbid patterns.

{"book_id":"2547","rating":4,"review_text":"\"Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror \n But you are eternity and you are the mirror\" \n The Prophet is a poetic narrative of philosophical thoughts. Author Khalil Gibran is a Lebanese writer and this work is considered to be his masterpiece.He introduces us to an old man, the prophet, a wanderer and a mystic, who is leaving the island of Orphalese to go back to his homeland. \n As the ship is seen arriving towards the island after twelve years of wait, people of the island surround the old man to bid him farewell.They are sad that he will leave them soon. In their sadness, they urge the old man to share with them his wisdom before he goes, and the old man is pleased to speak all he knows. \n Yet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us your truth.And we will give it unto our children, and they unto their children, and it shall not perish. \n Then one by one citizen asks him to tell about the different aspects of life. What the old man responds is all this book is about. \n It is a short book with only 96 pages, of which 8 pages have abstract artworks. The thoughts shared in the book are profound and often offers a different perspective of looking at things. It is to be read slowly and the ideas should be let to form an enigmatic painting in the mind. I will share some excerpts, which I readily admired reading. \n And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course. \n Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself. \n . \n Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights. \n But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge. \n You would know in words that which you have always known in thought. \n . \n You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts: \n And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime. \n And in much of your talking thinking is half murdered. \n For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly. \n . \n Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, \n Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.","date":"2016-07-02"}

I was surprised to find that its mention of the massive flood similar to that of Noah's Ark in the Bible. It's a short read, but one that is surely worthwhile.
